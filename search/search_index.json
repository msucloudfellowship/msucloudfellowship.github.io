I have experience in database design, R, Python and web application programming. I've worked in research IT for over 25 yrs for departments and labs across MSU, including for MSU ICER as a research consultant and trainer. I'm currently the technical lead for the data science team in the Analytics and Data Solutions or A.D.S , part of MSU's central IT services. Like many I've built and worked with on-campus linux systems for many years including the MSU HPC. I started my cloud journey in 2017 during a workshop at the HPC conference where I saw Ian Foster (our textbook author) present his vision of research on the cloud. Since then I've used cloud services from Google, Amazon and Azure, currently focusing on Microsoft Azure. At MSU ADS we use cloud services where appropriate for our data systems or applications, and I'll use examples directly from our work in this class. Dr. Brian O'shea Professor and Director, MSU ICER Role: Program Lead, ICER Dr. Brian O'Shea is a computational and theoretical astrophysicist studying cosmological structure formation, including galaxy formation and the behavior of the hot, diffuse plasma in the intergalactic medium and within galaxy clusters. He is also a co-author of the Enzo AMR code, an expert in high performance computing, and an advocate for open-source computing and open-source science. He received his B.S. in Engineering Physics at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in 2000, and his PhD in physics from UIUC in 2005 (with 2002-2005 being spent as a graduate student in residence at the Laboratory for Computational Astrophysics at UC San Diego and in the Theoretical Astrophysics Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory). Following that, he was a Director's Postdoctoral Fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory, with a joint appointment between the Theoretical Astrophysics Group and the Applied Physics Division. Since 2008, he has been a member of the faculty at Michigan State University, with a joint appointment between the Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering (2015-present), the Department of Physics and Astronomy (2008-present), and the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (2014-present). From 2008-2015, Dr. O'Shea was a member of Lyman Briggs College. He has authored or co-authored over 75 peer-reviewed journal articles in astrophysics, computer science, and education research journals, and has received a variety of awards for his teaching and public outreach efforts. In 2016, he became a Fellow of the American Physical Society, and in 2019 he became the director of MSU's Institute for Cyber-Enabled Research. Dr. Mahmoud Parvizi Research Consultant, MSU ICER Role: Assistant Instructor Mahmoud earned his PhD in physics from Vanderbilt University with research in high-energy theory in the context of early universe cosmology as well as computational astrophysics. In addition, Mahmoud earned an MBA with a concentration in finance from the University of Michigan - Flint. Mahmoud was formerly a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Michigan State University with a focus on machine learning applications of cloud-computing workflows and currently a research consultant for the MSU Institute for Cyber-Enabled Research (ICER). He participated as a cloud fellow in 2019 and co-instructor of the cloud fellowship in 2020. Mahmoud\u2019s diverse research interests include mathematical and theoretical physics, data-intensive astrophysics, machine learning for precision health, and cloud-computing platforms for academic research. His expertise include: 1) quantum field theory in curved/non-stationary spacetimes; 2) finite temperature quantum field theory and open quantum systems; 3) automated and end-to-end intelligent data pipelines for signal processing using compressed sensing and applied harmonic analysis; 4) machine learning and cloud-computing applications for precision health.

However there are disadvantats to this : 1. the main OS disk is typically deleted when the VM is deleted, although yuo can create a 'durable' disk to share 1. the data on the main OS disk is tied to that Virtual Machine and hence that operating system, that is, it's typically unacceesbile from other cloud services 1. it is limited in size. The largest of virtual disks are around 1 TB. Azure Cloud storage accounts are limited to 5 TB and you may have multiple storage accounts. 1. You can only move data to/from a virtual or shared disk storage using a virtual machine 1.

The goals of this session are to orient you to this program, set-up our technology, introduce ourselves, provide some background on cloud computing, and discuss what all of our expectations are. For this session, like the others, we have some pre-session activities for the week, followed by a meeting Friday 2-3:30pm. Readings Chapter 1: Orienting in the cloud universe from \"Cloud Computing for Science and Engineering\", Foster and Gannon ( Alternative link to publisher preview chapter ) Using Cloud Computing for Academic Research , Mahmoud Parvizi (draft version) Activities: Please complete the following activities prior to our first synchronmous meeting September 3. Start with Microsoft Teams You should have all been given access to a Team \"MSU ICER Cloud Fellowship\" via your NetID. See MSU's documentation on how to use MS Teams here: https://tech.msu.edu/technology/collaborative-tools/spartan365/ ( the link on that page requires yet another MSU log-in) please log-in to Teams and post message in the main channel just saying \"hello\" with your name and department and how you prefer to be addressed. Confirm Access to Azure Portal go to https://portal.azure.com log-in with your MSU netid and password click on the 'subscriptions' button and confirm the MSU cloud fellowship is there on the main page (Azure calls this the 'dashboard') ensure you see a \"resource group\" called TBD you don't need to (and shouldn't) create any new resources or work with this website, simply confirm you have access and can see the resources. thank you!
