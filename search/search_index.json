Researchers using the cloud must know a little about a lot of information technology to get computational work done in their domain specialty. Most cloud glossaries are for systems administrators, not the rest of us. This glossary is much more brief than Wikipedia and hopefully also provides the context a researcher needs to find what you need to use cloud services in your work. Do you have an item to add? Please contact us ! Other Glossaries https://www.cloudbank.org/cloud-terms The Glossary Azure Resource Manager ARM ARM Template JSON-formatted file that the ARM can use to create resources for you. Templates are a great shortcut and automation feature but difficult to edit. Blob Storage (Azure) Azure's object cloud storage, similar to S3 and google cloud storage buckets. CPU Central Processing Unit Arm CPU Most computers run Intel CPUs, but another company has compatible processessor that are slightly different. Some computational work is sensitive to CPU choice, and CPU choice can affect costs. Containers Or Docker Containers (not all containers need to be Docker the vast majority of container system use Docker). For R users, see https://colinfay.me/docker-r-reproducibility/ For Python users, there is https://www.netguru.com/blog/python-docker-tutorial although you could read either. Containers are a way to create a Linux-in-a-box that is more effieccient than a VM, and has a language for building containers meaning you can provision an entire system from code down to installing all the packages you need and copying your own program into it. Containers are widely use to package and distribute complex research software systems for example Bioinformatics workflow system \"Cromwell.\" This way reseearches can download and use a pre-installed system without the trouble of getting all of the pre-requistes (dependencies) installed on their machine. Docker is great for DevOps. DevOps This has many definitions but for researchers the shortcut is using code to make IT infrastructure. Helping developers (like you) do Ops (like sysadmins) with code. see IaC. Docker Docker is the most prevalent form of \"Containers\", e.g Docker is to containers as google is to search. See containers above for details. Note that Docker is many things as once: a method and format for Linux containers, a program for working with container ( e.g. docker build... ), a Company, and that's company's hub or repository for storing and access free containers (or your own). Cloud companies also have \"hubs\" or repositories for storing your own Docker containers. File Storage (Azure) Azure cloud storage that is more traditional file sharing, and that can be connected (mounted) to computers and other services using the SMB protocal, making it similar experience to departmental shared fileserver Firewall A common concept in networking, firewall software on a computer's networking components limits which kind of traffic can come in or out, and restricts which computer internet addresses can connect. Best practices suggest closing all connections via the firewall, only opening those connections for services you need, and only to those users (e.g. your own computer) you need to. Azure additionally has an option to \"allow connections from Azure networks\" so that you can freely connect from the portal, 'cloud shell', or connect from on azure service to another. The implication is that you trust all Azure services. GPU From Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit GPUs can be very helpful for some code written to use them, especially many machine learning libraries, and Virtual Machines may be provisioned with GPUs. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) In stead of using a GUI, or manual steps to create cloud computing, cloud resources may be created using scripts that interact with the cloud provider's api, and additional scripts can configure individual resources (such as to install software on a VM or configure a database). Doing this kind of \"provisioning\" with scripts makes it reproducible and debuggable which is at the heart of the Workflow or DevOps mentality. IP Address a unique string of characters that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network. Your computer will have a different IP address depending on where you are located (home, work, field). In addition, a home wifi router will assign a 'local' ip address for inside your home, but your 'public' internet IP address will be different. To find your own IP address, simply google \"what is my ip.\" All Azure services (VMs, data systems, etc) are assigned IP addresses via networking. see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/public-ip-addresses Object Storage From NetApp \"What is object storage? : \"...also known as object-based storage, is a strategy that manages and manipulates data storage as distinct units, called objects. These objects are kept in a single storehouse and are not ingrained in files inside other folders. Instead, object storage combines the pieces of data that make up a file, adds all its relevant metadata to that file, and attaches a custom identifier.\" Blob storage is object storage. Objects (e.g. files) are retrieved from a large system via their identifier, not their name. Amazon S3 and Google Cloud storage are also object stores. On-prem \"On Premise\" refers to technology (computers, disks, networking, etc) that are on your institutions computer centers or in your own lab. Note that for some researchers, \"on-prem\" can still mean remove (e.g. our HPC is only accessible remotely, so it may not be obvious that it's on premise to users). Resource For AWS and Azure, a resource is an entity that you can work with. The means something you can created, edit or delete via their cloud interface. Could be a computer (virtual machine), a whole cluster (azure batch pool), or some tiny network setting (IP address). Resoures almost always cost money. Resources are listed in your standard dashboard. Resource Group Organizational scheme unique to Azure. Nearly all resources must be part of a group and the resource group must be selected (or created ) when creating other resources. Resource groups could be used for specific projects, for 'personal' resources used for multiple projects (or for azure things like cloud shell). Resource Manager Azure calls the system they use to interface between you and cloud resources the \"Azure Resource Manager\" or ARM. There used to be a different way to interact with resources hence this has a specific name, also becuase it adds consistency to the interface to Virtual Machine (aka VM) Creating a simulated computer hardware using software, to be able run a guest operating system inside a host system, such that the guest thinks it's running on an actual computer. Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) Google Tensor Processing Unit is specialized computer chip similar to GPUs , used by deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow ( which leads to the question of \"what is a tensor\" and that depends on who you ask but similar to matrix. Service Level Agreement (SLA) Level of service you expect from a vendor, laying out the metrics by which service is measured, as well as remedies or penalties should agreed-on service levels not be achieved. In Cloud this is often spells out 'uptime,' which is percent of time the system is not down, e.g. 99.99%, and guarantees against data loss and availability. For most research, uptime is not important as we are our own customer and can tolerate some downtime. Services Cloud \"services\" are often bundles of resources pulled together for coordinate function. Cloud companies offer hundreds of often closely overlapping services.","title":"Cloud Glossary"},{"location":"cloud_glossary/#glossary-of-cloud-terms","text":"","title":"Glossary of Cloud Terms"},{"location":"cloud_glossary/#why","text":"Researchers using the cloud must know a little about a lot of information technology to get computational work done in their domain specialty.

It's my own take on this topic written with researchers in mind. However it should not replace Azure official documentation. The link below has a great summary of how it's setup. However you may ignore all the other sections in the \"Azure setup guide\" as this is geared for IT professionals adoption cloud for their own organization Microsoft Azure Documentation: Organize your Azure resources effectively Azure is organized by directories of user accounts and subscriptions. All resources must be created in exactly one \"subscription\" which is a method for billing and for setting permissions. Your organizations \"directory\" is where your user account lives, but you may have access to multiple subscreiptions with one user. MSU created a \"cloud fellowship\" subscription for all activities and resources for this, and we added your MSU directory accounts this subscription. Cloud computing components are known as \"resources,\" which AWS defines as \"an entity you can work with.\" Anything you can create using a cloud interfaces is a \"resource.\" To help with more organization, in Azure, resources belong to a resource group. Resource groups can collect resources by project which could still have hundreds or just a few resources. There is no restriction and up to you to organize how it works for you. For example, a lab could have a resource group for each member, or perhaps a resource group for each project, and members collaborate on those projects. It's also possible to restrict access to resource groups, e.g. a resource group for a project may only allow those who are working on the project access to that resource group. Azure has other organizational tools such management groups across subscriptions, complex identity management and role-based access control (RBAC) that we won't cover here. However, this is mostly for organization and resources may be accessed from one resource group to another, and even across subscriptions. Applying this organization scheme requires practice and sometimes vigilance. For most campuses, researchers will want to have their IT department create the subscriptions and billing as they often can get discounted prices or fee waivers.

All account must come from a directory (but an account can be multiple directories) Management groups : we won't use these, for admins to manage multiple subscriptions) Subscription : tied to a billing account, and where all resources are created. Resource Group : organizational tool for resources. Think of it as a \"folder\" in your file system Resource : any cloud entity you may work with (e.g. create, configure, destroy) Finally, it is possible to log-in to the Azure portal (e.g. your MSU account) and not have a valid subscription and not be able to create or access any resources. If you have never used Azure before, you may be asked to create a free trial. If are a you need to use Azure (e.g. for training) and do not have access to an MSU subscription, you may want to use a non-MSU email address and create your own account. Azure \"tags\" add added to resources (including resource groups) and are a way to identify and locate resources by search as for many other services. They are optional but highly recommended to use a tagging scheme to help organize your resources and for cost analysis. You can use any keys and any values you find useful. Azure Locations or Regions Subscriptions are for accounting only and don't represent concrete cloud resources. However cloud resource must reside in computer somewhere, and hence have a location. Locations for cloud providers for can be thought of inside one of their massive data centers. In Azure, \"region\" and \"location\" are used interchangably (some interfaces use 'location, some use 'region') Resources and Resource groups must be assigned a location when you create them. considerations are 1) does the location actually provide the services you need (not all locations have all cutting edge products) and 2) is the location close to you to reduce time it takes for data to cross the internet to/from you and finally 3) is there some restriction based on your country of origin. Most of the time, simply choose the default which is East US which almost always has the latest features. For some advantage for data transfer, choose (US North Central US). However as a rule select a location/region and use that across all of your resources so that, for example, your data files in storage are close to (in the same data center as) a computer you may create. Regions become very important for companies that offer services around the world and want to reduce the connection time for their customers. It's also possible to have back-ups of resources in different region to protect against natural disasters.","title":"Azure Organization"},{"location":"session_how_to_cloud/azure_organization/#azure-organization","text":"This is a brief description of how Azure cloud services are organized for those just getting started with Azure.

Prior to doing this exercise, please read Azure Organization For more background on how azure is structured. For definition of terms used in this walkthrough , refer to our Cloud Glossary including \" resource \", \" azure resource manager \" and \" resource group \" or our list of cloud references for introduction to cloud computing. For this activity we'll be using the web interface which Azure calls the \"Portal\" but that is only one of several ways to interface with Azure , but it can be a great place to start exploring and trying new services. Many of the activities you can accomplish in the portal you can accomplish with the other (command line or code) interfaces. Azure's own overview of the Portal is here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-overview Please refer to that as well as this material. Orientation to the Azure Portal The link above is to a video that walks through the description and tutorial steps below, hosted on MSU MediaSpace ( requires MSU Log-in) This assumes you have an Azure account and a valid subscription. For the purposes of this introduction, we assume that your account currently does not have ability to create a new subscription, resource group, Log-in to https://portal.azure.com with your MSU Netid. If you are a current member of the fellowship and you have difficulty logging in, please contact us right away. orientation: dashboard view. Azure portal first presents a \"dashboard\" which is organized into panels that show some aspect of your cloud account. You may alter the panels on this dashboard to show you the services and aspects of azure that are most important to you. For information on how to create customize your dashboard, see \" Create a dashboard in the Azure portal .\" In the standard, default version of the dashboard the first panel is a list of resources. If you have not created any resources yet you won't see anything. We will explorer resources later in this introduction. The standard dashboard panes are a list of your current resources (which may be in multiple resource groups), an advertisement with a link to learn about some new Azure service, and more links to create things the Azure has decided are most important to you. We will focus on the \"All Resources Pane\" If you click on anything here you can almost always use the back button to get back to the dashboard, or use the menu (described below) Top Bar Menu: the top menu ( three horizontal bars) is are links to many of the things also on the main dashboard. The \"home\" view is not the same as the dashboard but is a list of links to things Azure guess you may want to create, and a list of all of your resources. If you click \"resource groups\" in this list, you should see only one resource group (if any) unless you've been added to others or a different subscription. Search bar: in the middle of the top of the screen is white box in which you can type search terms include the kind of resource you want to see or create, or part of the name of specific resource you've created. This is what I use to create and find resources most of the time (and rarely use the links provided), more on that later. Shortcut buttons: the next few icons are short cuts to other functionality in the portal: cloud shell: see (link TBD) directories: about your subscription notifications: alerts when things change (when they are created, deleted) settings : most will not be valuable unless you create many resources, but feel free to change these, although do not change your email address help/support feedback : to the Azure people A note about portal navigation: When you click anything in the portal, it creates a new window without reloading the browser and with an X at the top right. This mimics a \"close window\" function and You can use the X return to the dashboard, or you may simply use the menu and go to where you need to Notice that like most things there are 4-5 ways to get to anywhere. Creating storage account with the Azure portal Note: It's ok if you would like to repeat this tutorial, there will be minimal costs and you may delete the resources you create (instructions for deleting at the end). You don't need to know about Cloud storage to complete this tutorial. This is simply an exercise to see how to create something use the Azure portal, and cloud storage is a benign (and very inexpensive) resource to use an example. You need a place to keep your stuff for a long time (persist your data) and cloud storage is a durable and inexpensive system for storage nearly unlimited files (or 'objects' in cloud terms). However as we will discover cloud storage is not the same as \"disk storage\" and works differently. Hence you need a storage \"account.\" Requirements: An Azure Account with valid subscription A Resource group All members of the current cloud fellowship cohort have these things Tutorial Steps. Log-in to the Azure portal if you have not already: https://portal.azure.com Click the menu (top left, three horizontal bars) to open it Select \"home\" from the menu - this ensures we all have the same view In the upper part of the screen is a list of \"Azure Services\" : click \"create a resource\" \\ Yes we could have click \"storage accounts\" instead but we want to demonstrate how to use the next screen... This \"create a resource\" screen is where you can create almost any service Azure offers, and additional services created by third-parties or companies that are not Microsoft. When you are starting, ensure you are creating a service from Microsoft (we'll show you how in the next step) Note there are now two search bars: one at the top of the screen, and on a bit lower titled \"Search services and marketplace\" - use that second search bar in the lower search bar, type \"Storage account\" Note that \"storage\" alone lists many other kinds of resources. You may see a list of several services, select (click) the first one labelled \"Storage account\" (icon looks like a spreadsheet). The description of the service will say the provider, which should be Microsoft, if not go back using the back button and search for storage account again. Click \"create\" The azure resource creation screens mostly work like this: there are so many settings Azure has split these up into groups which are listed horizontally across the top. You may work though these by clicking each group, OR finish a screen, and click \"Next..\" button on the bottom of the form. At any time you may click \"Review and Create\" and if you've missed some crucial setting, Azure will not let you create the resource without fixing it. We will go page-by-page for these settings Basics: Subscription: Cloud Fellowship Resource Group: Select your resource group (you may only have the one) \\ You may see a \"create new\" link below that but it may not work and for this tutorial we using an existing resource group Storage Account Name: This name must be unique for this region in azure, so Use your NetID for part of the name replace \"NETID\" with your MSU NetID here: \"cf21NETIDstorage\" e.g. cf21billspatstorage If you are repeating this tutorial, simply add a \"2\" or \"cf21billspatstorage2\" some resources have restrictions on naming. Next to storage account is an \"i\" in a circle that has more information. For storage accounts, they must be unique in region, and only numbers and lowercase letters are allowed. I don't know if Non-US letters are allowed (e.g.\u7bb1) Region (Location): You may leave US East, or click to select something closer to MSU (e.g. North Central US) Performance: Standard Redundancy: change from GeoRedundant to \"Locally Redundant\" (LRS) although we won't see a different, LRS is cheaper \\ beneath that, leave the \"make read access....\" box checked. Click \"next...Advanced\" Advanced: Leave all of these settings as-is. Networking: leave all of these settings as-is Data Protection: leave all as is. These settings allow you to recover files up to 7 days after deleting or over-writing Tags tags are optional but highly recommended. Tags are notes to yourself about the resource, use them for metadata. At MSU ADS we always have a tag with the key \"created by\" and value the netid of the creator. You may consider using a tag like \"project\" with value for the project if either 1) a project may have multiple resource goups or 2) a resource group would have multiple projects. tags can be added and removed at will from resources without altering the resource, so add as many tags as you want when starting to see how they may work Review and create review gives you a chance to double check your settings before committing click \"create\" Deployment Azure calls the process of creating cloud resources a \"deployment.\" This term comes from the software engineering process of first \"building\" an application or utility (or \"compiling\" which is often not necessary for scripting languages like Python or R) and then moving that application onto the IT servers that make it available. On your own computer you download software that is already \"built\" (e.g. MS Word) and installing it is a form of deployment. Deployment takes a while as the Azure Resource Manager takes your order and runs the code to generate the cloud resource you've described. You may leave this page and the deployment will continue in the background. finish and review When the deployment is complete, in the top bar of the Azure portal, You'll see a number badge on the \"Notification\" icon indicating the number of messages you have (probably just 1 ). Click on the Notifications icon to show this message. the message should be something like: Deployment succeeded Deployment 'resourcename_12345678901234' to resource group 'group name' was successful. \"Go to Resource\" button will open the Portal page with options for the resource \"Pin to Dashboard\" will create a new tile that is a shortcut to this resource on your dashboard for easy access. If you want to experiment with dashboard arranging then it's ok to click this and easy to remove later from your Portal Dashboard (it will be added to the bottom) Examine Resource (storage ) We have not talked about how storage works but the storage resource page is a good example to learn how the Portal is organized. If you didn't already click \"go to resource\", open the top menu and click \"home\" the Portal \"Home\" has a list of \"recent resources\" and this should be at the top. Click on this new cloud storage to view aa About Portal \"Resource\" Pages Most cloud resources in the portal have a list of categories on the left side, and pages for each category in the center. The first page is the \"Overview\" which has the resource group, subscription, and other info important for that resource. this followed by the \"Activity Log\" showing how the resource has been used. Each of the following items on the left side is a new page of additional options to alter how the resource is configured. For example if you click the \"tags\" section you see the tags you added (if any) and can modify or add new tags. Some of the options are not available on the forms when you create the resource, or the names of the options on these resource pages do not match the forms when you created the resources. In that case you may have to use two steps to configure the resource as you like, or better consider using a programmatic interface Again we did not discuss any of the characteristics of cloud storage or how to use it but you should now have enough familiarity with the azure portal to follow other tutorials to create and use storage or other resources.","title":"Exercise: Azure Portal Walk-through and Storage account creation"},{"location":"session_how_to_cloud/azure_portal_walkthrough/#exercise-azure-portal-walk-through-and-storage-account-creation","text":"MSU Cloud Fellowship","title":"Exercise: Azure Portal Walk-through and Storage account creation"},{"location":"session_how_to_cloud/azure_portal_walkthrough/#about","text":"This is an exercise and introduction to the web interface to manage Microsoft Azure cloud services.

This excercise assumes you understand how to use the Azure Portal, which is covered in the Azure Portal Walkthrough . In addition it's helpful to know what a virtual machine is but it's not crucial to complete the excercise. For more information on VMs see the slides from session 2 and readings from the \"Virtual Machine Background\" section We will use a pre-configured virtual machine with software already installed ( for both versions). When creating a VM you can use an Azure template and there are many of these. The Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) from Azure has R, Python and many data science and statistical libraries available. For more information about the Azure DSVM see https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/ Alternative Activities Azure has \"quick starts\" that are much more simplified than this demonstration: Requirements for both activities You need an account in azure with an active subscription, and a resource group of your own to work in. Fellows have these things provided. Creating and Connecting to a Windows Virtual Machine Requirements To connect to a Windows VM desktop, it's recommend you use the Microsoft Remote Desktop client. MacOS : install the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client, only available on the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12 Linux users install http://xrdp.org/ Windows Users ensure you have the client : In the search box on the taskbar, type Remote Desktop, and then select Remote Desktop Connection. Creating a Windows Virtual Machine If at any point, or if you are exploring, you can't seem to get the configuration correct (or there is a validation error you can't fix), starting over will not create any resources or incur charges. Go back to step 1 below. 1. Selecting the Resource Template In the Azure Portal open the top left menu, and click \"+ Create a resource\" option (the first option) In the create resource search box, type \"data science virtual machine\" In the options select Data Science Virtual Machine - Windows 2019 The \"Plans\" section has a description of the template if you would like to know more. Click the \" start with a pre-set configuration \" option. 2. select the pre-set configuration These configurations help to select your VM size based on your activity. We will use the default options and click \"Continue to create a VM\" The options do not affect the outcome of the exercise so at this step explore each option Click \" Continue to create a VM \" 3. Configure the VM using the Azure Portal The resource creation forms work as described in the Azure Portal but since we used a pre-set configuration some of the values will be completed. Basics The Subscription should be \"Cloud Fellowship\" and resource group should be your CF resource group (with your netid). As we create additional resource groups for this Virtual machine name Name: CF21-netid-dsvmtest One option is to combine the project (e.g. the fellowship), your net id, and some description of what you are doing. In the name above, replace \"netid\" with your own MSU netid. Note that different resources have different naming restrictions. For example VMs the rules are \"can be almost anything, but Azure resource names cannot contain special characters \\/\"\"[]:|<>+=;,?*@&, whitespace, or begin with '_' or end with '.' or '-' \" Note if you have an existing VM with this name, add a number 2 or other suffix. We will delete this VM and create something more suitable in the future. 1. Region Select \"(US) North Central US\" 1. Availability Options select \"No infrastructure Redundancy required\" this option is for critical infrastructure that needs to withstand a serious outage (e.g. if a hurricane affects a data center). You may also see an \"availability zone\" option appear (perhaps with an error message \"The value must not be empty\" ). Selecting \"\"No infrastructure Redundancy required\" in the availability zone will remove the \"availability zone\" field and error message. 1. Image should be \"Data Science Virtual Machine - windows...\" if this is change you may 1. Azure Spot Instance leave unchecked. 1. Size You can leave the size that is currently selected. This is how you select the specifications for CPU and memory. The size you for this exercise doesn't matter for the outcome, but it will show prices which may be interesting. If you click this drop-down menu you may see some other sizes and prices. The Monthly price assumes 24 hour/day operation. Your price to experiment will often be less than $1.00 1. Administrator Account Just like you need to log-in to your own computer, you must create a user account for the VM. Select a User name and account that you will easily remember, because you will need it to log-in to the new VM. * username : use any user name you will easily remember, perhaps your netid * password : something you can remember, but is complex to be secure. Do not use your MSU password or any other passwords you use 1. Licensing Unlike Linux, Windows requires a license, and this option are for organization with an arrangement with Azure. Leave this box unchecked. Disks and Other Settings For this exercise we'll be using the default values for almost all the pages except for Basics page. However you are encouraged to look through these options to see what is involved in creating a virtual machine. The Azure VM documentation covers many of them. For example a VM requires several networking components. The good news is that Azure will name and create these for you, which will see. Tags Using tags will be essential for identifying which components go to which VM. This is the metadata associated with these resources. I suggest using a tag like \"activity\" to indicate which of our activities was used to create these resources. Click \"tags\" in the top row of options (just before 'review and create') In the first row, For Name , type activity and for the Value type session2 click \"review and create\" Review and Create If there are errors the form name will have a red dot next to it. Go back to that form and see what may be the issue. If the Validation passed, it will display the approximate hourly cost to use this VM. Mine says 0.1920 USD/hr Click \"Create\" and the deployment will start. It will take at most 15 minutes. 4. The Resources While the deployment is in progress you may explore the operation details or click any of the resources that have been created. Open your resource group in the portal: click the portal menu on the top left, and select \"resource groups\" From the list, select your CF21 group. When the deployment is finished, you should see several new resources They will have the same name prefix \"CF21netid-dsvm\" but may have a suffix indicating the kind of resource (e.g. CF21-netid-dsvm1-ip The second column is the \"type\" which helps identify what they are click for a large view in a new tab/window Select the item with type \"virtual machine\" and click on the name to open its resource page (for example, cf21-billspat-dsvmtest item in the screenshot above) 5. The VM Resource Page To see the details for your virtual machine, click the VM in your resource group if you haven't already. click for larger view There are many details here but some immediate things to notice: in the top row are buttons to connect, start, restart and stop the vvm. in the top, \"essentials\" section the \"status\" should be \"running.\" on the right side is the assigned IP address which you need to connect. Hightlight and copy and paste this address. If you click the link on the address, it will take you to a new resource page just for the IP address (which is a distinct resource assigned to this VM resource) 6. Connecting You may connect to this VM running the Windows operating system with either graphical desktop, a command line connection, or both. The following Azure documentation describes how to connect to a Windows VM: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/connect-logon Here are more detailed instructions: There is a 'connect' link above the 'essentials' list, and a connect link on the left side - they both go to the same place. Connect with RDP (remote desktop protocol) is a Microsoft method for connecting to the graphical desktop. For Mac/Linux requires additional software (mentioned at the beginning of this page). Click \"connect\" and select \"rdp\" if it isn't already. click \" download RDP file \" button and save the .rdp file anywhere on your computer that you find it again after it's download, and if you Mac users have installed the RDP client, then double click the .rdp file to open your remote desktop software. On windows, any security or error messages, click \"connect\" Alternatively you may also open your RPD software without downloading the RDP file, and copy the IP address listed on and paste the IP address that is listed on the resource page for the VM When you connect, if the VM is not running, you will get an error message. Here is what the Windows screen looks like: This is because we are using a temporary certificate but it is secure. Click \"Yes\" Enter the Username and password you used when configuring the VM in the \"Basics\" section above. you may be able to simply enter the user name and password directly If not, in the Windows Security window, select More choices and then Use a different account. Enter the credentials for an account on the virtual machine and then select OK. If the user account you entered does not work, you may have to put your user account in domain\\username form, and in this case, the domain is the name of the virtual machine and it is entered as vmname\\username, with a back-slash in-between, and with the same password. Once you connect, you may see Windows starting up and installing things. Feel free to close any windows. Once the installations are finished, you may use the machine as you would any other windows computer. If you type Rstudio in the search box, you may launch an Rstudio session on this remote computer. It also has Python, many python libs and Jupyter notebook. We will cover how to transfer code and files to a VM in a later session. When you finished with your remote session you may simply close the remote windows (leaving the VM running. See below for how to turn it off and delete it. Optional: Connect to the Windows DSVM with ssh This windows machine has an SSH Server running, and the security settings from the pre-configured version allow connections from SSH. If you are familiar with ssh and the command line, you may start the CMD.EXE on your windows computer, or the Mac Terminal, and enter ssh <username>@<ipaddress> Where the username is the user you put for your VM when you created it, and the Public IP address is listed on the VM Resource page. This is similar to how you connect to the MSU HPC, if you are HPC user. You will be asked to add the host to your list hosts, and enter the password you used when you created the VM. When you log-in you will be connected to the Windows command prompt (e.g. C:\\Users\\username> To Exit, type exit at the command prompt. 7. Staring and Stopping the VM There are three ways to \"stop\" or turn off a VM. 1. when connected to it, e.g. in the remote desktop, use Windows to turn it off. The VM is then \"stopped.\" The VM is not running, but it is still \"allocated.\" When you turn it back on, it will come on immediately. 1. Use the Azure portal to \"stop\" the VM which shuts down Windows (gracefully if possible) and 'deallocates' the VM. Restarted the VM appears to be the same process, but Azure must allocate resources first to run it, then power it up. This is cheaper then the first method in the long run 1. Delete it. Stopping (deallocating) the VM with the Portal : Go to the resource page for the VM, if you are not already. If you are just entering the portal, find your resource group, find the VM in your resource group (identified as a VM in the \"type\" column of the list of resources), and click to open the resource page. The Status field near the top of this screen will indicate running or stopped. Find the Start and Stop buttons near the top of this screen and click \"stop\" if the machine is running. There is a warning about losing your IP address, with a check box to reserve it. If you plan on deleting the VM now, click \"ok\" If you plan on restarting the VM and reconnecting, first check the box \"reserve the IP\" then click OK The default is to use a \"dynamic\" address which is assigned everytime you turn on the VM When using a dynamic address, you must copy/paste the ip address, or re-download the RDP connection file everytime you restart the machine the solution is to use a \"Static IP\" either when you create the VM, or assiging one after the VM is created. and checking the box does so. you can also convert to a static IP with the portal, but it is not a straightfoward process, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-static-private-ip-arm-pportal Pricing for a static ip is here: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/ip-addresses/ which as of now is $0.0036/hour which is charged even if the VM is turned off. That is approx $2.70/month It's a good idea to leave VMs in a \"stopped (deallocated)\" state if you are not using them for computations or providing a service, just as you would turn off or put your laptop to sleep. The main reason for this is for security. 8. Deleting the Resources Open the Resource group as above When creating resources using the template as we did above, the resources associated with this VM will all start with the same prefix, so they are easy to identify. Select them with checkboxes, and click the \"Delete\" button which is on the top right of the screen (not the \"delete resource group\" button) If it's not obvious which resources are all included, you may also use the \"tag\" you created to filter what is listed and only show those with the same \"tag.\" For more information see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/manage-filter-resource-views . IF you add filter on tag, then you may select all the items that are shown, and delete those. after selecting confirm the deletion by typing \"yes\"","title":"Exercise: Creating a Windows Virtual Machine (VM)"},{"location":"session_how_to_cloud/azure_windows_vm_walkthrough/#exercise-creating-a-windows-virtual-machine-vm","text":"MSU Cloud Fellowship","title":"Exercise: Creating a Windows Virtual Machine (VM)"},{"location":"session_how_to_cloud/azure_windows_vm_walkthrough/#about","text":"This is an exercise and introduction to creating Virtual Machines (VMs) and related resources using the Azure Portal.

Deleting the Resources"},{"location":"session_how_to_cloud/intro_to_cloud_interfaces/","text":"Interfacing with Cloud Services Cloud Services are by design DIY or on-demand and hence need a programming interface to create cloud resources. This is only possible becuase inside the data center, computer configuration can be done completely with code, also knows as \"Infrastructure as Code\" (IaC). Amazon's insight was that they could slap a website on top of that, put a system for tracking (metering) usage, and sell it. All of the cloud companies as their base use a web interface, so-called REST API . Knowing the details of REST is not important but it's often the basis for all of the other style of interfaces. Here is an example web api URL for weather forecast , with parameters for coordinates, units and format of output https://www.7timer.info/bin/astro.php?lon=113.2&lat=23.1&ac=0&unit=metric&output=json&tzshift=0 Very few researchers would ever use the REST api directly, instead would use the web interface or even better the command line or programming language interface which achieves the same goal with less work. In Azure, everything you could possibly create is called a \"resource:\" a machine, a data service, a single network address. The system to work with Azure resources is the \"Azure Resource Manager\" or ARM and the primary interface for the Resource Manager is their web (REST) api. You may see references to resources in documentation and that means any web doo-dad. Summary of Cloud Interfaces This summary is focused on Microsoft Azure, but the other cloud companies have similar concepts. In addition to this guide, Chapter 1 of our text \"Cloud Computing for Science and Engineering\" has an excellent description and examples of these interfaces with examples from AWS. See the section of that chapter titled \"Accessing a cloud service\" in https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/a-book/Orienting.html Graphical Web Interface Most people want a graphical user interface, and for azure that's the \"Portal\" or https://portal.azure.com . For Google cloud it's the \"console\" and for AWS it's also called the console. See below for an introduction to using the portal. Note that the Azure portal and Google console both have web-based terminals that allow you to use the CLI directly in the web interface. Desktop Applications Azure provides some desktop applications for working with a few of the widely used cloud services : Azure Storage Explorer: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/ Can create cloud storage and upload/download data. We will use that for our session on Storage Azure Data Studio: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/what-is-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15 Can connect to and work with data systems (such as databases ) that are on your computer, on a system on campus, or hosted in Azure Command Line For those not familar wiht the command line, see https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-the-linux-terminal for linux and for Windows Powershell see https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-powershell The command line interface is a great way to interact with cloud services because it's imperative and all options are specified in a single command. With the web interface, you may have to hunt through the user interface to find the checkbox for an option, but for command line Azure has two command line interfaces: The \"CLI\" which is based on Linux and will work in any linux or Mac terminal (or shell script) and the \"Powershell\" interface which is for Windows Powershell users. Since Powershell has been ported to Linux and Mac and the Linux Shell and Azure CLI can also be used on Windows, so both are operating system independent but in practice, Windows users use powershell and everyone else uses the CLI. Your choice depends on the kinds of other systems you'll be working with. For example, the MSU HPC uses Linux command shell but Windows servers and other Windows services like SQLServer work well with Powershell. SDK : Software Developer Kit A \"software developer kit\" is simply a collection of utilities, libraries/packages and documentation for a specific language to work with a specific service. All the cloud vendors have SDKs, and they all have SDKs for Python. SDK simply means you can create, delete, interact with cloud services from your program. Why leave python or R if don't have to? Python SDK All cloud vendors have SDKs to work with Python. After installing the SDK, you import the libraries and issue commands to create resources, then use those cloud resources to do work via client libraries (either Azure libraries or others). Azure has extensive documentation for using Python: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/?view=azure-python Example Azure code to create cloud storage, compared with how you would see the resources in the azure portal, and similar commands using the CLI : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/azure-sdk-example-storage?tabs=cmd Note that Azure also has a service \"Azure Cloud Functions\" that run python that are not the same thing as the SDK. These are 'serverless' resources (similar to AWS Lambda), which we will learn about later in the course. Both AWS and Google Cloud have Python SDKs, and probably other vendors. R Unlike the other vendors, Microsoft maintains an SDK for R Users which allows you to create cloud services directly from Rstudio. See their github pages https://github.com/Azure/AzureR and excellent documentation throughout the packages. Cloud company frameworks In addition to the \"SDKs\" for existing languages, cloud companies often have their own frameworks for using code to build (provision) infrastructure. For Azure, these are \"ARM Templates\" and for AWS it's Cloud Formation . Azure: ARM templates Azure has a system for submitting a template, or essentially a configuration file to the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) that dictates which cloud resources are to be created. For Azure these are JSON-formatted files that are \"declaritive\" (rather than procedural or imperative like Python). The best way to understand these is to explore the many that Microsoft posts on github, and to try them. If you do, be mindful to delete any resources you create so as not to be charged for them. - Overview of ARM templates: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview - Quick start ARM templates (github): https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates Third-party programming with Terraform There are other ways to 'program the cloud' from companies outside of the big three. One widely used frame is \"Terraform\" from Hashicorp, not affiliated with any cloud company. The ad - Terraform: https://www.terraform.io - Can work with any vendor including Azure - Often more readable than ARM templates, Syntax remarkably simple - Focus on maintaining consistent systems ( declarative) - Does not cover all services, but can fall back to ARM templates when necessary Building Cloud from Cloud This may not be an 'interface' but is operationally similar. It's possible to use some of the above interfaces on existing cloud services, e.g. creating new cloud resources automaticaly from existing cloud resources. Your cloud architecture may need different types of resources, or parameterized resources only as needed (e.g. depending data inputs, a web-gateway for cloud on demand). For example Azure Logic Apps can create resources when they are run (e.g. provision and start a computer) and a logic app can be triggered by events such as when a new file is created, or using a web api (e.g. REST POST command that sends data and parameters). This adds significant complexity and is only valuable for event-based systems opens up using the cloud as a big computer programming language.

This is only possible becuase inside the data center, computer configuration can be done completely with code, also knows as \"Infrastructure as Code\" (IaC). Amazon's insight was that they could slap a website on top of that, put a system for tracking (metering) usage, and sell it. All of the cloud companies as their base use a web interface, so-called REST API . Knowing the details of REST is not important but it's often the basis for all of the other style of interfaces. Here is an example web api URL for weather forecast , with parameters for coordinates, units and format of output https://www.7timer.info/bin/astro.php?lon=113.2&lat=23.1&ac=0&unit=metric&output=json&tzshift=0 Very few researchers would ever use the REST api directly, instead would use the web interface or even better the command line or programming language interface which achieves the same goal with less work. In Azure, everything you could possibly create is called a \"resource:\" a machine, a data service, a single network address. The system to work with Azure resources is the \"Azure Resource Manager\" or ARM and the primary interface for the Resource Manager is their web (REST) api.

The challenge for researchers learning about cloud is that most cloud documentation for isn't written for you. Cloud training and documentation are mostly written for IT professionals like system admins and architects, software developers, business people, and agency managers. Researchers tend to be a little of all of those things. Training materials ofen have an embedded conceptual models of computing, and this model depend on your approach. Our goal as researchers is to get our work (or the work of our lab) done, not to build systems used by hundreds of people or for business purposes. That can make it difficult to decipher which kind of cloud service will work best for your use case. As Dr. Parvizi writes, cloud is very different from using traditional research-oriented technology like workstations or HPC. There are hundreds of services to choose from but we find many researchers will reach for the conceptually straightfoward path of creating cloud computers and install what they need. Our goal for this fellowship is to provide context and background, and help you explore some of the so-called \"cloud native\" technologies like \"serverless\" systems that let you run your scripts without dealing with operating system installs. The target audience for most cloud companies are IT professional building IT systems for public or institutational use. Let's call this the \"Systems\" perspective: built for someone else to use, e.g. a service must be available at scale and ultimately reliable documentation is in terms of historic IT systems house in on-premise corporate data centers \"production\" systems often very concerned with authentication and security The second audience are corporate software engineers, or dot-com or app software companies.

Cloudbank training videos NIST defintions of cloud: Service Levels and You The NIST definition of cloud computing defines service models, but what does \"X as a service\" actually mean, and where are the lines drawn? Like the species concept in biology, it's not always cut and dried, but can be thought of as a spectrum Infrastructure (aaS): Nuts and bolts, DIY, Lego. You need understanding of computing architecture as these services Everything in between: Platforms or pre-configured and managed infrastructure Software (aaS): Little to no configuration is needed but these system may be programmable and integrated with other services. E.g. Office 365, Google Drive The sweet-spot for researhces who do not have time to aquire the expertise to manage low-level infrastructure and need something more flexible and programmable than Software, are the platforms. These are often more expensive than DIY infrastruture, but are faster to provision and provide security controls. Cloud \"Services\" and the Packaging of Open Source Systems Case Study on Open Source system as Cloud service: MySQL Open source, free Relational database, e.g. SQL.

A \"Google Docs\" for Databases? Perhaps https://www.airtable.com/ ? Caveats and help As part of this fellowship, our goal is to help you translate documentation written for the systems and developer perspectives into a research perspective. The cloud services themselves are always changing, even slightly, making technology-specific tutorials obsolete in months. For example last year Azure had a \"Notebook Service\" for running Python notebooks, and now there is this in place of the regular documentation: What happened to Azure Notebooks? There are new services and bundles created all the time that may be competing or superior choices for doing research If you are unsure, ask us. See the contact page or use our Teams channel. During the cloud fellowship we are here to provide some answers, context for what you are seeing, or possible directions to explore. Cloud companies have help desks and many resources for anyone using their services or potential customers and we may be able to connect you with those. The Interfaces to Cloud A defining aspect of cloud computing is that it's \"on-demand\" hence creation of resources must be automated or \"scriptable.\" All Cloud providers have various 'interfaces' to their services that include both programmatic and web-based. We will talk about about how these in detail next sesion, but at the end of this session we will do a walk through of using the Azure portal, which is also an exercise for next session. Using workflow and computational thinking Karl Popper stated that \"non-reproducible single occurrences are of no significance to science\" ( K Popper, \"The Logic of Scientific Discovery\", English translation from Routledge, London, 1992, p. 66. ) and this is a significant issue for research computing and one of much academic work. To enhance reproducibility in your own work, consider documenting all the steps needed for create the environment to run your computation. For many on-premise academic systems (e.g. the MSU HPCC), we depend upon the system administrators to create that environment, but we may install and configure all the software we need to run our code. Workflow thinking can apply to the scienfic domain itself (e.g. \"Principles for data analysis workflows\" https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008770 ) and to the provisioning of the cloud computing environment. That is, we may use a workflow system for creating all the cloud stuff we need, and then a different workflow system that runs on that cloud stuff. One example is we may create an HPC system on Azure using templates and then launch the Slurm scheduler on that HPC to run our jobs. ( note the complexity of running our own HPC is beyond the scope of this fellowship and used as an example only ) A major advantage to using workflows or code for provisioning your cloud computing components is that you can turn them off and delete them when you are done, and restart when needed. This can dramatically save on costs . This does not necessarily have to be a complete programming system, but some combination of well written instructions and a collection of scripts so that your colleague (or yourself 6 months from now) can recreate everything you need. About Cloud Security Security and Risk management is an important issue even for researchers who's data may not be sensitive or even open source. Attackers may use the services you create to launch attacks on other services, leaving you liable. Finding a readable list of security recommendations for cloud computing is a challenge for all the reasons outlined above. Our textbook has a nice chaper outlining cloud security The \"Shared responsibility\" model for cloud computing takes a model of computing components, and shows how much of each component the user is responsible for security: Microsoft Model of Shared Responsibility for Cloud Computing We will come back to this model as we gain deeper understanding of research computing on the cloud. Costs and Budget overview We will cover the details of pricing, examine costs, and controlling costs in future sessions. Each participant has a budget for their Azure resources that they should stay under. If you need to use Google or AWS we need to make additional arrangements but your first step would be to acquire a free starter account with these companies (e.g. using a gmail address). Briefly: Costs are more than just dollars for services. Consider [Total Cost] = ( $ + Time + Risk ) [Total Time] = ( development time + wait time + compute time ) Risk is rarely non-significant. Never say \"I won't get hacked...\" In the Service level spectrum, the higher level \"platform\" services may have higher monetary costs but often reduce time and risk HPCC vs Cloud Dr. Parvizi's white paper outlines the challenges of adapting HPC workflows to cloud computing. The HPC is amazing effective at running all kinds of systems at very list cost, if any, to MSU researchers. Many systems not designed for HPC can be adjusted to run in that environment. However, just like many workflows are difficult to port from HPC to cloud, some cloud workflows are difficult run on HPC (but never say never): Big Data systems (see magpie project) Long-running Data Systems like database servers Web-based applications (see on-demand project) Containers (see singularity project) Acknowledging bias in access to cloud computing across research cultures Additional comments from instructors and organizers Summary and additional comments","title":"Practical Introduction for Researchers on Azure"},{"location":"session_introduction/lecture_introduction_to_cloud_computing_research/#practical-introduction-for-researchers-on-azure","text":"","title":"Practical Introduction for Researchers on Azure"},{"location":"session_introduction/lecture_introduction_to_cloud_computing_research/#introducing-cloud-computing-vs-research-computing","text":"","title":"Introducing cloud computing vs. research computing"},{"location":"session_introduction/lecture_introduction_to_cloud_computing_research/#learning-how-to-learn-about-cloud","text":"You may have looked at the various websites and poked around the web, and found it's just not clear at all how cloud computing may be helpful to you, even though it all sounds great. The challenge for researchers learning about cloud is that most cloud documentation for isn't written for you. Cloud training and documentation are mostly written for IT professionals like system admins and architects, software developers, business people, and agency managers. Researchers tend to be a little of all of those things. Training materials ofen have an embedded conceptual models of computing, and this model depend on your approach. Our goal as researchers is to get our work (or the work of our lab) done, not to build systems used by hundreds of people or for business purposes. That can make it difficult to decipher which kind of cloud service will work best for your use case. As Dr. Parvizi writes, cloud is very different from using traditional research-oriented technology like workstations or HPC. There are hundreds of services to choose from but we find many researchers will reach for the conceptually straightfoward path of creating cloud computers and install what they need. Our goal for this fellowship is to provide context and background, and help you explore some of the so-called \"cloud native\" technologies like \"serverless\" systems that let you run your scripts without dealing with operating system installs. The target audience for most cloud companies are IT professional building IT systems for public or institutational use. Let's call this the \"Systems\" perspective: built for someone else to use, e.g. a service must be available at scale and ultimately reliable documentation is in terms of historic IT systems house in on-premise corporate data centers \"production\" systems often very concerned with authentication and security The second audience are corporate software engineers, or dot-com or app software companies.
