Researchers using the cloud must know a little about a lot of information technology to get computational work done in their domain specialty. Most cloud glossaries are for systems administrators, not the rest of us. This glossary is much more brief than Wikipedia and hopefully also provides the context a researcher needs to find what you need to use cloud services in your work. Do you have an item to add? Please contact us ! Other Glossaries https://www.cloudbank.org/cloud-terms The Glossary Arm CPU CPU from \"Advanced RISC Machines, ltd. While historically most computers used Intel CPUs, ARM provides an alternative CPU that is becoming more popular and present as an option in HPC and Cloud Virtual Machine options. The vast majority of software written for Intel computers is compatible with ARM. Some computational work is sensitive to CPU choice, and CPU choice can affect cost and speed of excecution, so it may be important to understand the implications of this choice of CPU. ARM Template A specification file listing all of the cloud resources and configuration settings tha that the Azure Resource Manager can use to create resources for you when you submit it a certain way. Templates are a great shortcut and automation feature but difficult to edit. For details see Azure Documentation: What are ARM templates? Azure Resource Manager (ARM) see Resource Manager =#### Blob Storage Azure calls there object cloud storage \"Blobs\". It is similar to Amazon Web Service 'S3' and Google cloud storage buckets. Azure Documentation: Introduction to Azure Blob storage While it's possible to 'mount' blob storage to linux VMs using 'blob fuse' or similar packages, it can not work as you may expect and so in practice Azure Files are a better solution for that. See File Storage Client-Server Client/Server model of computing is something we use everyday but perhaps dont' use this term. See https://techterms.com/definition/client-server_model You are used to using maybe a dozen clients everyday (phone apps, web browser, ssh to connect to a remote linux, Remote Desktop client to connect to remote desktop server, etc). Cloud computing provides all the infrastructure needed to create servers quickly and easily. Containers Or Docker Containers (not all containers need to be Docker the vast majority of container system use Docker). For R users, see https://colinfay.me/docker-r-reproducibility/ For Python users, there is https://www.netguru.com/blog/python-docker-tutorial although you could read either. Linux Containers is a term for a collection of methods and technologies that allows a multiple isolated systems to be run on one Linux computer. This is differnet from virtual machines in that a VM host provides abstract or virtualized hardware so each VM requires it's own portion of memory and CPU cores whereas containers share the main part of Linux (the kernel), memory and CPU more dynamically. The primary comercial company for containers is \"Docker\" so Docker is sometimes used synonymously with 'container' but it is just one form. In addition to being more efficient than VMs, most container systems have a system and scripting language for building containers. The means onecan provision an entire system from code. Containers are widely use to package and distribute complex research software systems for example Bioinformatics workflow system \"Cromwell.\" This way reseearches can download and use a pre-installed system without the trouble of getting all of the pre-requistes (dependencies) installed on their machine. CPU Central Processing Unit, the main 'chip' of a computer, and a core component when specifying a Virtual Machine 'size' DevOps This has many definitions but for researchers the shortcut is using code to make IT infrastructure. Helping developers (like you) do Ops (like sysadmins) with code. see IaC. Docker Docker is the most prevalent form of \"Containers\", e.g Docker is to containers as google is to search. See containers above for details. Note that Docker is many things as once: a method and format for Linux containers, a program for working with container ( e.g. docker build... ), a Company, and that's company's hub or repository for storing and access free containers (or your own). Cloud companies also have \"hubs\" or repositories for storing your own Docker containers. File Storage (Azure) Also called \"Azure Files.\" Azure cloud storage that is more traditional file sharing, and that can be connected (mounted) to computers and other services using the SMB protocal, making it similar experience to departmental shared fileservers. See https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/files/ and compare with Blob Storage Firewall A common concept in networking, firewall software on a computer's networking components limits which kind of traffic can come in or out, and restricts which computer internet addresses can connect. Best practices suggest closing all connections via the firewall, only opening those connections for services you need, and only to those users (e.g. your own computer) you need to. Azure additionally has an option to \"allow connections from Azure networks\" so that you can freely connect from the portal, 'cloud shell', or connect from on azure service to another. The implication is that you trust all Azure services. GPU From Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit GPUs can be very helpful for some code written to use them, especially many machine learning libraries, and Virtual Machines may be provisioned with GPUs. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) In stead of using a GUI, or manual steps to create cloud computing, cloud resources may be created using scripts that interact with the cloud provider's api, and additional scripts can configure individual resources (such as to install software on a VM or configure a database). Doing this kind of \"provisioning\" with scripts makes it reproducible and debuggable which is at the heart of the Workflow or DevOps mentality. IP Address a unique string of characters that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network. Your computer will have a different IP address depending on where you are located (home, work, field). In addition, a home wifi router will assign a 'local' ip address for inside your home, but your 'public' internet IP address will be different. To find your own IP address, simply google \"what is my ip.\" All Azure services (VMs, data systems, etc) are assigned IP addresses via networking. see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/public-ip-addresses Object Storage From NetApp \"What is object storage? : \"...also known as object-based storage, is a strategy that manages and manipulates data storage as distinct units, called objects. These objects are kept in a single storehouse and are not ingrained in files inside other folders. Instead, object storage combines the pieces of data that make up a file, adds all its relevant metadata to that file, and attaches a custom identifier.\" Blob storage is object storage. Objects (e.g. files) are retrieved from a large system via their identifier, not their name. Amazon S3 and Google Cloud storage are also object stores. On-prem \"On Premise\" refers to technology (computers, disks, networking, etc) that are on your institutions computer centers or in your own lab. Note that for some researchers, \"on-prem\" can still mean remove (e.g. our HPC is only accessible remotely, so it may not be obvious that it's on premise to users). Resource For AWS and Azure, a resource is an entity that you can work with. The means something you can created, edit or delete via their cloud interface. Could be a computer (virtual machine), a whole cluster (azure batch pool), or some tiny network setting (IP address). Resoures almost always cost money. Resources are listed in your standard dashboard. Resource Group Organizational scheme unique to Azure. Nearly all resources must be part of a group and the resource group must be selected (or created ) when creating other resources. Resource groups could be used for specific projects, for 'personal' resources used for multiple projects (or for azure things like cloud shell). Resource Manager Azure calls the system they use to interface between you and cloud resources the \"Azure Resource Manager\" or ARM. There used to be a different way to interact with Azure resources, hence this has a specific name and is referred to in Microsoft documentation. Serverless This buzz-word applies to many different cloud services, primarily those that the cloud company manages for you, usually referring to cloud functions (AWS Lamba) and sometimes others in the \"Platform As A Service\" service model . The origin is that, if you run virtual machines with operating systems and software install, your are maintaining servers to support that software. If the cloud service does not require you to provision and maintain a server, it is often marketed as \"serverless\" (e.g. recent marketing of Azure Files as \"Serverless file shares\" where on-premise File Sharing requires staff to manage and maintain Windows File Servers. Service Models This is related to the \"... as a service\" (..aaS) phrases defined in the NIST document which included \"Infrastructure\", \"Platform\" and \"Softare\" as a service (IaaS, PaaS and SaaS). It's a conceptual organization of cloud services based on the stack model of computating with the infrastructure (network, hardware, CPU, etc) at the bottom and Software on the top. See The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing Service Level Agreement (SLA) Level of service you expect from a vendor, laying out the metrics by which service is measured, as well as remedies or penalties should agreed-on service levels not be achieved. In Cloud this is often spells out 'uptime,' which is percent of time the system is not down, e.g. 99.99%, and guarantees against data loss and availability. For most research, uptime is not important as we are our own customer and can tolerate some downtime. Services Cloud \"services\" are often bundles of resources pulled together for coordinate function. Cloud companies offer hundreds of often closely overlapping services. Tags AWS and Azure allow you add meta data to resource in the form of tags (e.g. hashtags, etc) which are keys and values. When you create a resource you can add a tag indicating the project it is for e.g. \"project\" = \"dna-methylation\" To add more detail if your DNA methylation has multiple aspects or experiments, add more tags like \"experiment\" = \"Fall 2021\" For workgroups it's stronlgy suggested you add a \"created_by\" = your netid because it's often difficult in Azure to determine who created a resource if it needs to be turned off or deleted. Use tags to organize your Azure resources and management hierarchy Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) Google Tensor Processing Unit is specialized computer chip similar to GPUs , used by deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow ( which leads to the question of \"what is a tensor\" and that depends on who you ask but similar to matrix. Virtual Machine (aka VM) Creating a simulated computer hardware using software, to be able run a guest operating system inside a host system, such that the guest thinks it's running on an actual computer.","title":"Cloud Glossary"},{"location":"cloud_glossary/#glossary-of-cloud-terms","text":"","title":"Glossary of Cloud Terms"},{"location":"cloud_glossary/#why","text":"Researchers using the cloud must know a little about a lot of information technology to get computational work done in their domain specialty.

Many universities provice great local systems at little no costs, and some research groups have existing systems they've invested in, whereas cloud computing is an on-going costs. Azure has a rich data ecosystem and there are many methods to copy data from our local research cluster ([MSU ICER HPCC) to Azure Storage. The follow are examples of methods that I've used, and all assume you are moving data to \"Azure Blob\" storage but may require minor adjustment to use \"Azure Files\" storage which should also work. I don't discuss \"queue\" or \"table\" storage at all and that my require other services to use (events or data factory) Method 1. using scp with a virtual machine Sometimes you don't need a durable storage account at all, you just need to get some data onto the virtual machine you are using for computation. This method is useful for one-time workflow of copy, process, save results. Requirements an account on the MSU HPCC basic knowledge of Linux know how to create and use a Azure Virtual Machine A little about the scp utility The HPC runs Linux, and The cp utility copies files from one folder to another. The scp utility allows us to do that across the network, using a secure method, providing you have an account on the remote system and ssh access. There are many programs to help with network file transfers but rsync and rclone are two command (and really great) programs to checkout. We will stick with scp for this example The basic format of the scp command is scp user@remote.system.com:path/to/remote/file path/to/copy_of_file For examples see http://www.hypexr.org/linux_scp_help.php Method 1a. simple method for a one-time copy to an Azure VM: Steps: 1. find the file on the MSU HPCC that you want to copy. Note the location and full path 1. create your Virtual Machine in Azure that you will use for your computations if it isn't already. - if the file is particularly large, make sure to create a VM disk that is large enough to contain it 1. log-in to the virtual machine with the username and password you created (with remote desktop, or for Linux with ssh) 1. if you are using Windows with remote desktop, start cmd.exe to get a terminal, if on Linux, you are already on the terminal 1. use an scp command like this: - first, note the folder you are running this from (it defaults to the VM home directory) - scp mynetid@hpcc.msu.edu:path/to/file.ext file.ext - you may be asked to accept the host 'fingerprint' if this is the first time you are using scp - enter your NetID password (it is not saved or visible on the command line) - consider using ssh keys instead of your password (which is a whole 'nother lesson) - see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/mac-create-ssh-keys Now you can access the file using the software from the I think of this as \"pulling\" data from HPC to the VM disk. Method 2. azcopy Requirements A Storage account. We created one in the first session, but create a storage account in your resource group if you don't have one yet. Create a container in storage account to hold files. This can be a Blob or Azure Files container You must be owner of the storage account, and able to assign permissions ('roles'). Azure requires special persmissions grant that are NOT granted by default to use azcopy. Details in the instructions below OR you must be willing to go through the process of creating a \"SAS Token\" : see my instructions for creating SAS token Assuming you have a storage account with a blob container already created. In the portal, open the storage account container. Azure provides a command line tool azcopy which you can download for windows, mac and Linux. see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10 How to install the azcopy utility Login to MSU HPCC ssh <netid>@hpcc.msu.edu download a copy of azcopy untar and put in your home directory How to use azcopy to upload to Azure using the \"AD Login\" Log in to HPCC assuming your copy of azcopy is in your home directory References: - Getting Started with azcopy - azcopy login reference - Authorize access to blobs with AzCopy and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) - Generate SAS tokens for your storage containers *(note I found this in the \"cognitive services\" documentation) Alternative Methods Method 3. Azure data factory We will cover what \"Azure Data Factory\" is in session 4, but this is included in this session for completeness. If you have some familiarity with Azure data factory, note that a \"source\" for Azure Data Factory\" can be an 'sftp' or 'secure file transfer protocol' which most systems that have 'ssh' (secure shell) access allow, and is simlar to using the 'scp' or 'secure copy' utility. Method 4. Python We won't cover using Python to copy files to/from blob storage, but see the optional exercise for using Azure cloud storage in Python.

It's my own take on this topic written with researchers in mind. However it should not replace Azure official documentation. The link below has a great summary of how it's setup. However you may ignore all the other sections in the \"Azure setup guide\" as this is geared for IT professionals adoption cloud for their own organization Microsoft Azure Documentation: Organize your Azure resources effectively Azure is organized by directories of user accounts and subscriptions. All resources must be created in exactly one \"subscription\" which is a method for billing and for setting permissions. Your organizations \"directory\" is where your user account lives, but you may have access to multiple subscreiptions with one user. MSU created a \"cloud fellowship\" subscription for all activities and resources for this, and we added your MSU directory accounts this subscription. Cloud computing components are known as \"resources,\" which AWS defines as \"an entity you can work with.\" Anything you can create using a cloud interfaces is a \"resource.\" To help with more organization, in Azure, resources belong to a resource group. Resource groups can collect resources by project which could still have hundreds or just a few resources. There is no restriction and up to you to organize how it works for you. For example, a lab could have a resource group for each member, or perhaps a resource group for each project, and members collaborate on those projects. It's also possible to restrict access to resource groups, e.g. a resource group for a project may only allow those who are working on the project access to that resource group. Azure has other organizational tools such management groups across subscriptions, complex identity management and role-based access control (RBAC) that we won't cover here. However, this is mostly for organization and resources may be accessed from one resource group to another, and even across subscriptions. Applying this organization scheme requires practice and sometimes vigilance. For most campuses, researchers will want to have their IT department create the subscriptions and billing as they often can get discounted prices or fee waivers.

Resource Group : organizational tool for resources. Think of it as a \"folder\" in your file system Resource : any cloud entity you may work with (e.g. create, configure, destroy) Finally, it is possible to log-in to the Azure portal (e.g. your MSU account) and not have a valid subscription and not be able to create or access any resources.

Azure \"tags\" add added to resources (including resource groups) and are a way to identify and locate resources by search as for many other services. They are optional but highly recommended to use a tagging scheme to help organize your resources and for cost analysis. You can use any keys and any values you find useful. Azure Locations or Regions Subscriptions are for accounting only and don't represent concrete cloud resources. However cloud resource must reside in computer somewhere, and hence have a location. Locations for cloud providers for can be thought of inside one of their massive data centers. In Azure, \"region\" and \"location\" are used interchangably (some interfaces use 'location, some use 'region') Resources and Resource groups must be assigned a location when you create them. considerations are 1) does the location actually provide the services you need (not all locations have all cutting edge products) and 2) is the location close to you to reduce time it takes for data to cross the internet to/from you and finally 3) is there some restriction based on your country of origin. Most of the time, simply choose the default which is East US which almost always has the latest features. For some advantage for data transfer, choose (US North Central US). However as a rule select a location/region and use that across all of your resources so that, for example, your data files in storage are close to (in the same data center as) a computer you may create. Regions become very important for companies that offer services around the world and want to reduce the connection time for their customers.

Prior to doing this exercise, please read Azure Organization For more background on how azure is structured. For definition of terms used in this walkthrough , refer to our Cloud Glossary including \" resource \", \" azure resource manager \" and \" resource group \" or our list of cloud references for introduction to cloud computing. For this activity we'll be using the web interface which Azure calls the \"Portal\" but that is only one of several ways to interface with Azure , but it can be a great place to start exploring and trying new services. Many of the activities you can accomplish in the portal you can accomplish with the other (command line or code) interfaces. Azure's own overview of the Portal is here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-overview Please refer to that as well as this material. Orientation to the Azure Portal The link above is to a video that walks through the description and tutorial steps below, hosted on MSU MediaSpace ( requires MSU Log-in) This assumes you have an Azure account and a valid subscription. For the purposes of this introduction, we assume that your account currently does not have ability to create a new subscription, resource group, Log-in to https://portal.azure.com with your MSU Netid. If you are a current member of the fellowship and you have difficulty logging in, please contact us right away. orientation: dashboard view. Azure portal first presents a \"dashboard\" which is organized into panels that show some aspect of your cloud account. You may alter the panels on this dashboard to show you the services and aspects of azure that are most important to you. For information on how to create customize your dashboard, see \" Create a dashboard in the Azure portal .\" In the standard, default version of the dashboard the first panel is a list of resources. If you have not created any resources yet you won't see anything. We will explorer resources later in this introduction. The standard dashboard panes are a list of your current resources (which may be in multiple resource groups), an advertisement with a link to learn about some new Azure service, and more links to create things the Azure has decided are most important to you. We will focus on the \"All Resources Pane\" If you click on anything here you can almost always use the back button to get back to the dashboard, or use the menu (described below) Top Bar Menu: the top menu ( three horizontal bars) is are links to many of the things also on the main dashboard. The \"home\" view is not the same as the dashboard but is a list of links to things Azure guess you may want to create, and a list of all of your resources. If you click \"resource groups\" in this list, you should see only one resource group (if any) unless you've been added to others or a different subscription. Search bar: in the middle of the top of the screen is white box in which you can type search terms include the kind of resource you want to see or create, or part of the name of specific resource you've created. This is what I use to create and find resources most of the time (and rarely use the links provided), more on that later. Shortcut buttons: the next few icons are short cuts to other functionality in the portal: cloud shell: see (link TBD) directories: about your subscription notifications: alerts when things change (when they are created, deleted) settings : most will not be valuable unless you create many resources, but feel free to change these, although do not change your email address help/support feedback : to the Azure people A note about portal navigation: When you click anything in the portal, it creates a new window without reloading the browser and with an X at the top right. This mimics a \"close window\" function and You can use the X return to the dashboard, or you may simply use the menu and go to where you need to Notice that like most things there are 4-5 ways to get to anywhere. Creating storage account with the Azure portal Note: It's ok if you would like to repeat this tutorial, there will be minimal costs and you may delete the resources you create (instructions for deleting at the end). You don't need to know about Cloud storage to complete this tutorial. This is simply an exercise to see how to create something use the Azure portal, and cloud storage is a benign (and very inexpensive) resource to use an example. You need a place to keep your stuff for a long time (persist your data) and cloud storage is a durable and inexpensive system for storage nearly unlimited files (or 'objects' in cloud terms). However as we will discover cloud storage is not the same as \"disk storage\" and works differently. Hence you need a storage \"account.\" Requirements: An Azure Account with valid subscription A Resource group All members of the current cloud fellowship cohort have these things Tutorial Steps. Log-in to the Azure portal if you have not already: https://portal.azure.com Click the menu (top left, three horizontal bars) to open it Select \"home\" from the menu - this ensures we all have the same view In the upper part of the screen is a list of \"Azure Services\" : click \"create a resource\" \\ Yes we could have click \"storage accounts\" instead but we want to demonstrate how to use the next screen... This \"create a resource\" screen is where you can create almost any service Azure offers, and additional services created by third-parties or companies that are not Microsoft. When you are starting, ensure you are creating a service from Microsoft (we'll show you how in the next step) Note there are now two search bars: one at the top of the screen, and on a bit lower titled \"Search services and marketplace\" - use that second search bar in the lower search bar, type \"Storage account\" Note that \"storage\" alone lists many other kinds of resources. You may see a list of several services, select (click) the first one labelled \"Storage account\" (icon looks like a spreadsheet). The description of the service will say the provider, which should be Microsoft, if not go back using the back button and search for storage account again. Click \"create\" The azure resource creation screens mostly work like this: there are so many settings Azure has split these up into groups which are listed horizontally across the top. You may work though these by clicking each group, OR finish a screen, and click \"Next..\" button on the bottom of the form. At any time you may click \"Review and Create\" and if you've missed some crucial setting, Azure will not let you create the resource without fixing it. We will go page-by-page for these settings Basics: Subscription: Cloud Fellowship Resource Group: Select your resource group (you may only have the one) \\ You may see a \"create new\" link below that but it may not work and for this tutorial we using an existing resource group Storage Account Name: This name must be unique for this region in azure, so Use your NetID for part of the name replace \"NETID\" with your MSU NetID here: \"cf21NETIDstorage\" e.g. cf21billspatstorage If you are repeating this tutorial, simply add a \"2\" or \"cf21billspatstorage2\" some resources have restrictions on naming. Next to storage account is an \"i\" in a circle that has more information. For storage accounts, they must be unique in region, and only numbers and lowercase letters are allowed. I don't know if Non-US letters are allowed (e.g.\u7bb1) Region (Location): You may leave US East, or click to select something closer to MSU (e.g. North Central US) Performance: Standard Redundancy: change from GeoRedundant to \"Locally Redundant\" (LRS) although we won't see a different, LRS is cheaper \\ beneath that, leave the \"make read access....\" box checked. Click \"next...Advanced\" Advanced: Leave all of these settings as-is. Networking: leave all of these settings as-is Data Protection: leave all as is. These settings allow you to recover files up to 7 days after deleting or over-writing Tags tags are optional but highly recommended. Tags are notes to yourself about the resource, use them for metadata. At MSU ADS we always have a tag with the key \"created by\" and value the netid of the creator. You may consider using a tag like \"project\" with value for the project if either 1) a project may have multiple resource goups or 2) a resource group would have multiple projects. tags can be added and removed at will from resources without altering the resource, so add as many tags as you want when starting to see how they may work Review and create review gives you a chance to double check your settings before committing click \"create\" Deployment Azure calls the process of creating cloud resources a \"deployment.\" This term comes from the software engineering process of first \"building\" an application or utility (or \"compiling\" which is often not necessary for scripting languages like Python or R) and then moving that application onto the IT servers that make it available. On your own computer you download software that is already \"built\" (e.g. MS Word) and installing it is a form of deployment. Deployment takes a while as the Azure Resource Manager takes your order and runs the code to generate the cloud resource you've described. You may leave this page and the deployment will continue in the background. finish and review When the deployment is complete, in the top bar of the Azure portal, You'll see a number badge on the \"Notification\" icon indicating the number of messages you have (probably just 1 ). Click on the Notifications icon to show this message. the message should be something like: Deployment succeeded Deployment 'resourcename_12345678901234' to resource group 'group name' was successful. \"Go to Resource\" button will open the Portal page with options for the resource \"Pin to Dashboard\" will create a new tile that is a shortcut to this resource on your dashboard for easy access. If you want to experiment with dashboard arranging then it's ok to click this and easy to remove later from your Portal Dashboard (it will be added to the bottom) Examine Resource (storage ) We have not talked about how storage works but the storage resource page is a good example to learn how the Portal is organized. If you didn't already click \"go to resource\", open the top menu and click \"home\" the Portal \"Home\" has a list of \"recent resources\" and this should be at the top. Click on this new cloud storage to view aa About Portal \"Resource\" Pages Most cloud resources in the portal have a list of categories on the left side, and pages for each category in the center. The first page is the \"Overview\" which has the resource group, subscription, and other info important for that resource. this followed by the \"Activity Log\" showing how the resource has been used. Each of the following items on the left side is a new page of additional options to alter how the resource is configured. For example if you click the \"tags\" section you see the tags you added (if any) and can modify or add new tags. Some of the options are not available on the forms when you create the resource, or the names of the options on these resource pages do not match the forms when you created the resources. In that case you may have to use two steps to configure the resource as you like, or better consider using a programmatic interface Again we did not discuss any of the characteristics of cloud storage or how to use it but you should now have enough familiarity with the azure portal to follow other tutorials to create and use storage or other resources.","title":"Exercise: Azure Portal Walk-through and Storage account creation"},{"location":"session_how_to_cloud/azure_portal_walkthrough/#exercise-azure-portal-walk-through-and-storage-account-creation","text":"MSU Cloud Fellowship","title":"Exercise: Azure Portal Walk-through and Storage account creation"},{"location":"session_how_to_cloud/azure_portal_walkthrough/#about","text":"This is an exercise and introduction to the web interface to manage Microsoft Azure cloud services.

Tags are notes to yourself about the resource, use them for metadata. At MSU ADS we always have a tag with the key \"created by\" and value the netid of the creator. You may consider using a tag like \"project\" with value for the project if either 1) a project may have multiple resource goups or 2) a resource group would have multiple projects. tags can be added and removed at will from resources without altering the resource, so add as many tags as you want when starting to see how they may work Review and create review gives you a chance to double check your settings before committing click \"create\" Deployment Azure calls the process of creating cloud resources a \"deployment.\" This term comes from the software engineering process of first \"building\" an application or utility (or \"compiling\" which is often not necessary for scripting languages like Python or R) and then moving that application onto the IT servers that make it available. On your own computer you download software that is already \"built\" (e.g. MS Word) and installing it is a form of deployment. Deployment takes a while as the Azure Resource Manager takes your order and runs the code to generate the cloud resource you've described. You may leave this page and the deployment will continue in the background. finish and review When the deployment is complete, in the top bar of the Azure portal, You'll see a number badge on the \"Notification\" icon indicating the number of messages you have (probably just 1 ). Click on the Notifications icon to show this message. the message should be something like: Deployment succeeded Deployment 'resourcename_12345678901234' to resource group 'group name' was successful. \"Go to Resource\" button will open the Portal page with options for the resource \"Pin to Dashboard\" will create a new tile that is a shortcut to this resource on your dashboard for easy access.

On mediaspace.msu.edu which requires a log-in About This is an exercise and introduction to creating Virtual Machines (VMs) and related resources using the Azure Portal. There are two nearly identical activities, and you only need complete one of them: creating a Windows virtual machine and connecting with a graphic interface (GUI), namely Remote Desktop (rdp) to demonstrate how you may use full graphic software (like Rstudio, Matlab, etc) on a cloud computer creating a Linux Virtual machine and connection with the command line to demonstrate how you may use a terminal interface (or scripting) on a cloud computer. We will use a pre-configured virtual machine with software already installed for both versions. When creating a VM you can use an Azure template and there are many of these. The Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) from Azure has R, Python and many data science and statistical libraries available. For more information about the Azure DSVM see https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/ and for the list of tools installed, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/tools-included Azure has a new product called \"Azure Machine Learning\" that we may cover in a future session. Requirements for both activities You need an Azure account with an active subscription, and a resource group of your own to work in. Fellows have these things provided. This exercise assumes you understand how to use the Azure Portal, which is covered in the Azure Portal Walkthrough . In addition it's helpful to know what a virtual machine is but it's not crucial to complete the exercise. For more information on VMs see the slides from session 2 and readings from the \"Virtual Machine Background\" section It's helpful to have basic understanding of the \"Client-Server\" model of computing as the VM we create will be running servers (remote desktop server for Windows, and ssh command line server for Linux) Creating a Windows Virtual Machine This section is based on Windows. For an equivalant exercise based on Linux, scroll down. If at any point, or if you are exploring, you can't seem to get the configuration correct (or there is a validation error you can't fix), starting over will not create any resources or incur charges. Go back to step 1 below. Requirements for Windows VMs To connect to a Windows VM desktop, it's recommend you use the Microsoft Remote Desktop client. MacOS : install the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client, only available on the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12 Linux users install http://xrdp.org/ Windows Users ensure you have the client : In the search box on the taskbar, type Remote Desktop, and then select Remote Desktop Connection. 1.

Click the \" start with a pre-set configuration \" option. 2. select the pre-set configuration These configurations help to select your VM size based on your activity. We will use the default options and click \"Continue to create a VM\" The options do not affect the outcome of the exercise so at this step explore each option Click \" Continue to create a VM \" 3. Configure the VM using the Azure Portal The resource creation forms work as described in the Azure Portal but since we used a pre-set configuration some of the values will be completed. Basics The Subscription should be \"Cloud Fellowship\" and resource group should be your CF resource group (with your netid). As we create additional resource groups for this Virtual machine name Name: CF21-netid-dsvmtest One option is to combine the project (e.g. the fellowship), your net id, and some description of what you are doing. In the name above, replace \"netid\" with your own MSU netid. Note that different resources have different naming restrictions. For example VMs the rules are \"can be almost anything, but Azure resource names cannot contain special characters \\/\"\"[]:|<>+=;,?*@&, whitespace, or begin with '_' or end with '.' or '-' \" Note if you have an existing VM with this name, add a number 2 or other suffix. We will delete this VM and create something more suitable in the future. 1. Region Select \"(US) North Central US\" 1. Availability Options select \"No infrastructure Redundancy required\" this option is for critical infrastructure that needs to withstand a serious outage (e.g. if a hurricane affects a data center). You may also see an \"availability zone\" option appear (perhaps with an error message \"The value must not be empty\" ). Selecting \"\"No infrastructure Redundancy required\" in the availability zone will remove the \"availability zone\" field and error message. 1.

Size You can leave the size that is currently selected, which is based on the pre-set configuration from the previous step. This is how you select the specifications for CPU and memory. The size you for this exercise doesn't matter for the outcome, but it will show prices which may be interesting. If you click this drop-down menu you may see some other sizes and prices. The Monthly price assumes 24 hour/day operation. Your price to experiment will often be less than $1.00 1. Administrator Account Just like you need to log-in to your own computer, you must create a user account for the VM. Select a User name and account that you will easily remember, because you will need it to log-in to the new VM. * username : use any user name you will easily remember, perhaps your netid * password : something you can remember, but is complex to be secure. Do not use your MSU password or any other passwords you use 1. Licensing Unlike Linux, Windows requires a license, and this option are for organization with an arrangement with Azure. Leave this box unchecked and Azure will add the extra charges (a few cents per hour) for the use of Windows. Disks and Other Settings For this exercise we'll be using the default values for almost all the pages except for Basics page. However you are encouraged to look through these options to see what is involved in creating a virtual machine. The Azure VM documentation covers many of them. For example a VM requires several networking components. The good news is that Azure will name and create these for you, which will see. Tags Using tags will be essential for identifying which components go to which VM. This is the metadata associated with these resources. I suggest using a tag like \"activity\" to indicate which of our activities was used to create these resources. Click \"tags\" in the top row of options (just before 'review and create') In the first row, For Name , type activity and for the Value type session2 click \"review and create\" Review and Create If there are errors the form name will have a red dot next to it. Go back to that form and see what may be the issue. If the Validation passed, it will display the approximate hourly cost to use this VM. Mine says 0.1920 USD/hr Click \"Create\" and the deployment will start. It will take at most 15 minutes. You should kkip down the the Viewing VM Resources section below/ Optional: Creating a Linux Virtual Machine This sections is nearly identical to the section above with Windows, but uses Ubuntu Linux, and does not use a graphical interface (although with some work this is possible). Requirements To connect to Linux you need an terminal or command line interface with an ssh client software. If you have used the MSU HPC, this is the same method for connection. On Mac, the Terminal.app has ssh On Modern version of Windows, the cmd.exe command prompt has an ssh command built in but there are other programs Linux desktop/laptops come with an ssh client Creating a Linux Virtual Machine If at any point, or if you are exploring, you can't seem to get the configuration correct (or there is a validation error you can't fix), starting over will not create any resources or incur charges.

You will be asked to download a key and use that key in your ssh command. The key is only available for download when you create this vm and if you lose it you can't connect. We can definitely cover how to use ssh keys as this is the preferred method for connecting.

Linux Users continue to the next section Viewing VM Resources in your Resource group (Windows and Linux) While the deployment is in progress you may explore the operation details or click any of the resources that have been created. Open your resource group in the portal: click the portal menu on the top left, and select \"resource groups\" From the list, select your CF21 group. When the deployment is finished, you should see several new resources They will have the same name prefix \"CF21netid-dsvm\" but may have a suffix indicating the kind of resource (e.g. CF21-netid-dsvm1-ip The second column is the \"type\" which helps identify what they are click for a large view in a new tab/window Select the item with type \"virtual machine\" and click on the name to open its resource page (for example, cf21-billspat-dsvmtest item in the screenshot above) The VM Resource Page To see the details for your virtual machine, click the VM in your resource group if you haven't already. click for larger view There are many details here but some immediate things to notice: in the top row are buttons to connect, start, restart and stop the vvm. in the top, \"essentials\" section the \"status\" should be \"running.\" on the right side is the assigned IP address which you need to connect. Highlight and copy and paste this address. If you click the link on the address, it will take you to a new resource page just for the IP address (which is a distinct resource assigned to this VM resource) Connecting Connecting to a Windows VM using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client You may connect to this VM running the Windows operating system with either graphical desktop, a command line connection, or both. The following Azure documentation describes how to connect to a Windows VM: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/connect-logon Here are more detailed instructions: There is a 'connect' link above the 'essentials' list, and a connect link on the left side - they both go to the same place. Connect with RDP (remote desktop protocol) is a Microsoft method for connecting to the graphical desktop. For Mac/Linux requires additional software (mentioned at the beginning of this page). Click \"connect\" and select \"rdp\" if it isn't already. click \" download RDP file \" button and save the .rdp file anywhere on your computer that you find it again after it's download, and if you Mac users have installed the RDP client, then double click the .rdp file to open your remote desktop software. On windows, any security or error messages, click \"connect\" Alternatively you may also open your RPD software without downloading the RDP file, and copy the IP address listed on and paste the IP address that is listed on the resource page for the VM When you connect, if the VM is not running, you will get an error message. Here is what the Windows screen looks like: This is because we are using a temporary certificate but it is secure. Click \"Yes\" Enter the Username and password you used when configuring the VM in the \"Basics\" section above. you may be able to simply enter the user name and password directly If not, in the Windows Security window, select More choices and then Use a different account. Enter the credentials for an account on the virtual machine and then select OK. If the user account you entered does not work, you may have to put your user account in domain\\username form, and in this case, the domain is the name of the virtual machine and it is entered as vmname\\username, with a back-slash in-between, and with the same password. Once you connect, you may see Windows starting up and installing things. Feel free to close any windows. Once the installations are finished, you may use the machine as you would any other windows computer. If you type Rstudio in the search box, you may launch an Rstudio session on this remote computer. It also has Python, many python libs and Jupyter notebook. We will cover how to transfer code and files to a VM in a later session. When you finished with your remote session you may simply close the remote windows (leaving the VM running. See below for how to turn it off and delete it. Optional: Connect to the Windows DSVM with ssh This windows machine has an SSH Server running, and the security settings from the pre-configured version allow connections from SSH. If you are familiar with ssh and the command line, you may start the CMD.EXE on your windows computer, or the Mac Terminal, and enter ssh <username>@<ipaddress> Where the username is the user you put for your VM when you created it, and the Public IP address is listed on the VM Resource page. This is similar to how you connect to the MSU HPC, if you are HPC user. You will be asked to add the host to your list hosts, and enter the password you used when you created the VM. When you log-in you will be connected to the Windows command prompt (e.g. C:\\Users\\username> To Exit, type exit at the command prompt. Next Steps: For information on turning off the VM and for eventually deleting the VM, scroll down below the Linux section as these operations are the same in the Azure portal for Linux or Windows virtual machines. Connecting to a Linux VM using SSH We will connect and use this remote VM running the Linux operating system with a command line connection. It is possible to use a graphical connection but requires additional setup beyond the scope of the short exercise. In addition this assumes you have some familiarity with using the command line and starting your terminal program. There is a 'connect' link above the 'essentials' list, and a connect link on the left side - they both go to the same place. Connect with SSH this is the standard method of connecting with ssh, but we've included as much detail as possible for those who are new to using ssh. On the main \"overview\" page of the VM resource, find the \"Public IP Address\" on the top right side. Copy this IP address to the clipboard, or make a note of it. Mine was 20.98.28.63. Note that these VMS also have an internal IP address that start with 10.x.x.x that will not work for connecting from your laptop. Use the Public IP address. not all VMs have a public IP address but this one will. also make a note of the User ID and password you used to create the VM above side note, in the \"connect\" form of the VM resource pages, it describes how to use an ssh key, even though we did not create an ssh key when we created a VM. If you did not create an ssh key, you do not need to follow these instructions. on your desktop/laptop, start your terminal program on MacOS/Linux or cmd.exe if you using Windows. Enter the command as displayed, which is something like ssh vmusername@vmipaddress In my case, my command is ssh patbills@20.98.28.63 If this is the first time connection, you'll get the standard ssh warning \"The authenticity of host '20.98.28.63 (20.98.28.63)' can't be established.\" simply say \"yes\" and enter Enter the password you used when configuring the VM in the \"Basics\" section above. (note that ssh does not show any key movement or * when you type a password) it takes a while to connect for the fist time as the VM configures software and prepares your user account You may use the machine as you would any other linux computer. For more information about what software is installed, see We will cover how to transfer code and files to a VM in a later session. When you finished with your remote session you may simply close the remote windows (leaving the VM running. See below for how to turn it off and delete it. Optional: Connect to the Windows DSVM with ssh This windows machine has an SSH Server running, and the security settings from the pre-configured version allow connections from SSH. If you are familiar with ssh and the command line, you may start the CMD.EXE on your windows computer, or the Mac Terminal, and enter ssh <username>@<ipaddress> Where the username is the user you put for your VM when you created it, and the Public IP address is listed on the VM Resource page. This is similar to how you connect to the MSU HPC, if you are HPC user. You will be asked to add the host to your list hosts, and enter the password you used when you created the VM. When you log-in you will be connected to the Windows command prompt (e.g. C:\\Users\\username> To Exit, type exit at the command prompt. Starting and Stopping the VM (both Windows and Linux) There are three ways to \"stop\" or turn off a VM. 1. when connected to it, e.g. in the remote desktop, use Windows to turn it off. The VM is then \"stopped.\" In a Linux ssh session you may use a command like sudo shutdown -h now When the Operating system is shut off, and hence tthe VM is not running, but it is still \"allocated.\" When you turn it back on, it will come on immediately. 1. Use the Azure portal to \"stop\" the VM which shuts down Windows (gracefully if possible) and 'deallocates' the VM. Restarted the VM appears to be the same process, but Azure must allocate resources first to run it, then power it up. This is cheaper then the first method in the long run 1. Delete it. Stopping (deallocating) the VM with the Portal: Go to the resource page for the VM, if you are not already. If you are just entering the portal, find your resource group, find the VM in your resource group (identified as a VM in the \"type\" column of the list of resources), and click to open the resource page. The Status field near the top of this screen will indicate running or stopped. Find the Start and Stop buttons near the top of this screen and click \"stop\" if the machine is running. There is a warning about losing your IP address, with a check box to reserve it. If you plan on deleting the VM now, click \"ok\" If you plan on restarting the VM and reconnecting, first check the box \"reserve the IP\" then click OK The default is to use a \"dynamic\" address which is assigned every time you turn on the VM When using a dynamic address, you must copy/paste the ip address, or re-download the RDP connection file everytime you restart the machine the solution is to use a \"Static IP\" either when you create the VM, or assigning one after the VM is created. and checking the box does so. you can also convert to a static IP with the portal, but it is not a straightforward process, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-static-private-ip-arm-pportal Pricing for a static ip is here: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/ip-addresses/ which as of now is $0.0036/hour which is charged even if the VM is turned off. That is approx $2.70/month It's a good idea to leave VMs in a \"stopped (deallocated)\" state if you are not using them for computations or providing a service, just as you would turn off or put your laptop to sleep. The main reason for this is for security. Deleting the Resources (both Windows and Linux) Open the Resource group as above When creating resources using the template as we did above, the resources associated with this VM will all start with the same prefix, so they are easy to identify. Select them with checkboxes, and click the \"Delete\" button which is on the top right of the screen (not the \"delete resource group\" button) If it's not obvious which resources are all included, you may also use the \"tag\" you created to filter what is listed and only show those with the same \"tag.\" For more information see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/manage-filter-resource-views . If you add filter on tag, then you may select all the items that are shown, and delete those. after selecting confirm the deletion by typing \"yes\" Creating resources just to delete them may seem wasteful however we will cover how to save a \"snapshot\" and/or \"image\" of your VM's disk so that you may re-use any work to install and configure software withtout incurring charges. More Refereences Azure has very abbreviated versions of this exercise if you would like another perspective. They assume you can create your own resource group (which you don't have the ability to do currently in the fellowship) https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/overview#next-steps Data Science Use Case Tutorials from Azure: Windows: This tutorial uses products that Azure no long supports, and for Windows users they really push to use their \"Azure Machine Learning\" product.

This exercise assumes you understand how to use the Azure Portal, which is covered in the Azure Portal Walkthrough . In addition it's helpful to know what a virtual machine is but it's not crucial to complete the exercise. For more information on VMs see the slides from session 2 and readings from the \"Virtual Machine Background\" section We will use a pre-configured virtual machine with software already installed . When creating a VM you can use an Azure template and there are many of these. The Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) from Azure has R, Python and many data science and statistical libraries available. For more information about the Azure DSVM see https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/ Requirements You need an account in azure with an active subscription, and a resource group of your own to work in. Fellows have these things provided. Creating and Connecting to a Windows Virtual Machine Requirements To connect to a Windows VM desktop, it's recommend you use the Microsoft Remote Desktop client. MacOS : install the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client, only available on the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12 Linux users install http://xrdp.org/ Windows Users ensure you have the client : In the search box on the taskbar, type Remote Desktop, and then select Remote Desktop Connection.

Go back to step 1 below. 1. Selecting the Resource Template In the Azure Portal open the top left menu, and click \"+ Create a resource\" option (the first option) In the create resource search box, type \"data science virtual machine\" In the options select Data Science Virtual Machine - Windows 2019 The \"Plans\" section has a description of the template if you would like to know more. Click the \" start with a pre-set configuration \" option. 2. select the pre-set configuration These configurations help to select your VM size based on your activity. We will use the default options and click \"Continue to create a VM\" The options do not affect the outcome of the exercise so at this step explore each option Click \" Continue to create a VM \" 3.

However you are encouraged to look through these options to see what is involved in creating a virtual machine. The Azure VM documentation covers many of them. For example a VM requires several networking components. The good news is that Azure will name and create these for you, which will see. Tags Using tags will be essential for identifying which components go to which VM. This is the metadata associated with these resources. I suggest using a tag like \"activity\" to indicate which of our activities was used to create these resources. Click \"tags\" in the top row of options (just before 'review and create') In the first row, For Name , type activity and for the Value type session2 click \"review and create\" Review and Create If there are errors the form name will have a red dot next to it.

Once the installations are finished, you may use the machine as you would any other windows computer. If you type Rstudio in the search box, you may launch an Rstudio session on this remote computer. It also has Python, many python libs and Jupyter notebook. We will cover how to transfer code and files to a VM in a later session. When you finished with your remote session you may simply close the remote windows (leaving the VM running. See below for how to turn it off and delete it. Optional: Connect to the Windows DSVM with ssh This windows machine has an SSH Server running, and the security settings from the pre-configured version allow connections from SSH. If you are familiar with ssh and the command line, you may start the CMD.EXE on your windows computer, or the Mac Terminal, and enter ssh <username>@<ipaddress> Where the username is the user you put for your VM when you created it, and the Public IP address is listed on the VM Resource page. This is similar to how you connect to the MSU HPC, if you are HPC user. You will be asked to add the host to your list hosts, and enter the password you used when you created the VM. When you log-in you will be connected to the Windows command prompt (e.g. C:\\Users\\username> To Exit, type exit at the command prompt. 7. Starting and Stopping the VM There are three ways to \"stop\" or turn off a VM. 1. when connected to it, e.g. in the remote desktop, use Windows to turn it off. The VM is then \"stopped.\" The VM is not running, but it is still \"allocated.\" When you turn it back on, it will come on immediately. 1. Use the Azure portal to \"stop\" the VM which shuts down Windows (gracefully if possible) and 'deallocates' the VM. Restarted the VM appears to be the same process, but Azure must allocate resources first to run it, then power it up. This is cheaper then the first method in the long run 1. Delete it. Stopping (deallocating) the VM with the Portal : Go to the resource page for the VM, if you are not already. If you are just entering the portal, find your resource group, find the VM in your resource group (identified as a VM in the \"type\" column of the list of resources), and click to open the resource page. The Status field near the top of this screen will indicate running or stopped. Find the Start and Stop buttons near the top of this screen and click \"stop\" if the machine is running. There is a warning about losing your IP address, with a check box to reserve it. If you plan on deleting the VM now, click \"ok\" If you plan on restarting the VM and reconnecting, first check the box \"reserve the IP\" then click OK The default is to use a \"dynamic\" address which is assigned every time you turn on the VM When using a dynamic address, you must copy/paste the ip address, or re-download the RDP connection file everytime you restart the machine the solution is to use a \"Static IP\" either when you create the VM, or assigning one after the VM is created. and checking the box does so. you can also convert to a static IP with the portal, but it is not a straightforward process, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-static-private-ip-arm-pportal Pricing for a static ip is here: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/ip-addresses/ which as of now is $0.0036/hour which is charged even if the VM is turned off. That is approx $2.70/month It's a good idea to leave VMs in a \"stopped (deallocated)\" state if you are not using them for computations or providing a service, just as you would turn off or put your laptop to sleep. The main reason for this is for security. 8. Deleting the Resources Open the Resource group as above When creating resources using the template as we did above, the resources associated with this VM will all start with the same prefix, so they are easy to identify. Select them with checkboxes, and click the \"Delete\" button which is on the top right of the screen (not the \"delete resource group\" button) If it's not obvious which resources are all included, you may also use the \"tag\" you created to filter what is listed and only show those with the same \"tag.\" For more information see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/manage-filter-resource-views .

This is only possible becuase inside the data center, computer configuration can be done completely with code, also knows as \"Infrastructure as Code\" (IaC). Amazon's insight was that they could slap a website on top of that, put a system for tracking (metering) usage, and sell it. All of the cloud companies as their base use a web interface, so-called REST API . Knowing the details of REST is not important but it's often the basis for all of the other style of interfaces. Here is an example web api URL for weather forecast , with parameters for coordinates, units and format of output https://www.7timer.info/bin/astro.php?lon=113.2&lat=23.1&ac=0&unit=metric&output=json&tzshift=0 Very few researchers would ever use the REST api directly, instead would use the web interface or even better the command line or programming language interface which achieves the same goal with less work. In Azure, everything you could possibly create is called a \"resource:\" a machine, a data service, a single network address. The system to work with Azure resources is the \"Azure Resource Manager\" or ARM and the primary interface for the Resource Manager is their web (REST) api. You may see references to resources in documentation and that means any web doo-dad. Summary of Cloud Interfaces This summary is focused on Microsoft Azure, but the other cloud companies have similar concepts. In addition to this guide, Chapter 1 of our text \"Cloud Computing for Science and Engineering\" has an excellent description and examples of these interfaces with examples from AWS. See the section of that chapter titled \"Accessing a cloud service\" in https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/a-book/Orienting.html Graphical Web Interface Most people want a graphical user interface, and for azure that's the \"Portal\" or https://portal.azure.com . For Google cloud it's the \"console\" and for AWS it's also called the console. See below for an introduction to using the portal. Note that the Azure portal and Google console both have web-based terminals that allow you to use the CLI directly in the web interface. Desktop Applications Azure provides some desktop applications for working with a few of the widely used cloud services : Azure Storage Explorer: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/ Can create cloud storage and upload/download data. We will use that for our session on Storage Azure Data Studio: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/what-is-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15 Can connect to and work with data systems (such as databases ) that are on your computer, on a system on campus, or hosted in Azure Command Line For those not familar wiht the command line, see https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-the-linux-terminal for linux and for Windows Powershell see https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-powershell The command line interface is a great way to interact with cloud services because it's imperative and all options are specified in a single command. With the web interface, you may have to hunt through the user interface to find the checkbox for an option, but for command line Azure has two command line interfaces: The \"CLI\" which is based on Linux and will work in any linux or Mac terminal (or shell script) and the \"Powershell\" interface which is for Windows Powershell users. Since Powershell has been ported to Linux and Mac and the Linux Shell and Azure CLI can also be used on Windows, so both are operating system independent but in practice, Windows users use powershell and everyone else uses the CLI. Your choice depends on the kinds of other systems you'll be working with. For example, the MSU HPC uses Linux command shell but Windows servers and other Windows services like SQLServer work well with Powershell. SDK : Software Developer Kit A \"software developer kit\" is simply a collection of utilities, libraries/packages and documentation for a specific language to work with a specific service. All the cloud vendors have SDKs, and they all have SDKs for Python. SDK simply means you can create, delete, interact with cloud services from your program. Why leave python or R if don't have to? Python SDK All cloud vendors have SDKs to work with Python. After installing the SDK, you import the libraries and issue commands to create resources, then use those cloud resources to do work via client libraries (either Azure libraries or others). Azure has extensive documentation for using Python: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/?view=azure-python Example Azure code to create cloud storage, compared with how you would see the resources in the azure portal, and similar commands using the CLI : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/azure-sdk-example-storage?tabs=cmd Note that Azure also has a service \"Azure Cloud Functions\" that run python that are not the same thing as the SDK. These are 'serverless' resources (similar to AWS Lambda), which we will learn about later in the course. Both AWS and Google Cloud have Python SDKs, and probably other vendors. R Unlike the other vendors, Microsoft maintains an SDK for R Users which allows you to create cloud services directly from Rstudio. See their github pages https://github.com/Azure/AzureR and excellent documentation throughout the packages. Cloud company frameworks In addition to the \"SDKs\" for existing languages, cloud companies often have their own frameworks for using code to build (provision) infrastructure. For Azure, these are \"ARM Templates\" and for AWS it's Cloud Formation . Azure: ARM templates Azure has a system for submitting a template, or essentially a configuration file to the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) that dictates which cloud resources are to be created. For Azure these are JSON-formatted files that are \"declaritive\" (rather than procedural or imperative like Python). The best way to understand these is to explore the many that Microsoft posts on github, and to try them. If you do, be mindful to delete any resources you create so as not to be charged for them. - Overview of ARM templates: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview - Quick start ARM templates (github): https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates Third-party programming with Terraform There are other ways to 'program the cloud' from companies outside of the big three. One widely used frame is \"Terraform\" from Hashicorp, not affiliated with any cloud company. The ad - Terraform: https://www.terraform.io - Can work with any vendor including Azure - Often more readable than ARM templates, Syntax remarkably simple - Focus on maintaining consistent systems ( declarative) - Does not cover all services, but can fall back to ARM templates when necessary Building Cloud from Cloud This may not be an 'interface' but is operationally similar. It's possible to use some of the above interfaces on existing cloud services, e.g. creating new cloud resources automaticaly from existing cloud resources. Your cloud architecture may need different types of resources, or parameterized resources only as needed (e.g. depending data inputs, a web-gateway for cloud on demand). For example Azure Logic Apps can create resources when they are run (e.g. provision and start a computer) and a logic app can be triggered by events such as when a new file is created, or using a web api (e.g. REST POST command that sends data and parameters). This adds significant complexity and is only valuable for event-based systems opens up using the cloud as a big computer programming language.

Your cloud architecture may need different types of resources, or parameterized resources only as needed (e.g. depending data inputs, a web-gateway for cloud on demand). For example Azure Logic Apps can create resources when they are run (e.g. provision and start a computer) and a logic app can be triggered by events such as when a new file is created, or using a web api (e.g. REST POST command that sends data and parameters).

See the links and materials for session 2: how to cloud for the necessary background. 1. Pricing Pages. All cloud vendors have pricing pages that describe how they meter and charge for services. For Azure this is https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/#product-pricing However I usually find the page I need quickly by simply googling azure <service name> pricing for example I wanted to see how much a static IP address costs in azure so googling 'azure static ip pricing' takes me to https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/ip-addresses/ Some of these pages are straightforward, but like the one above has addition knowledge. What does this mean in practice? For example, what does \"classic\" vs \"ARM\" even means? There is a link at the top of the page but this may take time to read and understand. I'll tell you that we will never use 'classic' and only use 'resource manager (ARM).' so look at the ARM Prices. This kind of background info is very common for services. 2. Build something and check the cost The other option is the empircal method: build something, use it, review the costs, and estimate. At the resource group in the protal ( see Azure Organization ), there is a link on the left-side menu, near the bottom labelled \"Cost Analysis\" - click that This is a live report of your current costs, with the ability to filter by time period, resource type, tags, and other things. Near the middle are rouded buttons controlling the view you see. At the right side of this is a button \"Add Filter\" which you can click to show costs only for some resources. For example if you click that and select \"Service Name\" and then \"virtual machines\" you will see the costs for the current month. A powerful filtering technique is to use tagging in Azure, which is akin to adding meta-data to resources. See the Cloud Glossary In many of the filtering mechanisms in Azure (including costs), the tag names (keys) use use are listed in the options for filtering. Carefully select the date range for which you want an estimate, especially if your trial run started a few days ago in the previous month as the default is a monthly estimate. Use a custom date range for the time period that makes sense for the costs you want to observe. Example Azure Cost Analysis Screen, filtered by Tag. Click for larger view 3.

For Azure it's https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/ Summary and other notes Combining these three methods is how we can estimate costs. Notes: Pricing often depends on the location or region you select. Most regions in the US are the same price. Data transfer costs are really hard to estimate. Transfer into the cloud (Ingress) is often free but out of the cloud (egress) usually has a charge. This is because companies with web products *(e.g. websites, web stores, image sites, etc) make money when customers view their pages (more customers => more costs =>but more revenue). However note that MSU has a deal with Azure and data transfer from Azure to MSU is (mostly) free.

The challenge for researchers learning about cloud is that most cloud documentation for isn't written for you. Cloud training and documentation are mostly written for IT professionals like system admins and architects, software developers, business people, and agency managers. Researchers tend to be a little of all of those things. Training materials ofen have an embedded conceptual models of computing, and this model depend on your approach. Our goal as researchers is to get our work (or the work of our lab) done, not to build systems used by hundreds of people or for business purposes. That can make it difficult to decipher which kind of cloud service will work best for your use case. As Dr. Parvizi writes, cloud is very different from using traditional research-oriented technology like workstations or HPC. There are hundreds of services to choose from but we find many researchers will reach for the conceptually straightfoward path of creating cloud computers and install what they need. Our goal for this fellowship is to provide context and background, and help you explore some of the so-called \"cloud native\" technologies like \"serverless\" systems that let you run your scripts without dealing with operating system installs. The target audience for most cloud companies are IT professional building IT systems for public or institutational use. Let's call this the \"Systems\" perspective: built for someone else to use, e.g. a service must be available at scale and ultimately reliable documentation is in terms of historic IT systems house in on-premise corporate data centers \"production\" systems often very concerned with authentication and security The second audience are corporate software engineers, or dot-com or app software companies. We'll call this the \"developer perspective need to easily create systems to run their software for demonstration and testing complete interelate goal is a robust sytem that can handle many users, e.g. the performance of a \"production\" systems are often top of mind And finally most closely related to your work are data science, \"machine learning\" or an \"analytical\" perspective systems to achieve computation. May work like our local HPC systems built only for small work groups, not for public can still scale but must be reproducible to document methods even this documentation can quickly veer off in to building production systems for companies to re-run inference say many times a data or with a constant stream of corporate data What is are the goals from research perspective for cloud computing? Custom: can create customized resources only when you need it On-demand: can run ad-hoc computations on those on-demand resources Reproducible: a computation can be re-run as needed, meaning cloud resources can be easily re-recreated to re-run your computations. Cost effective: unlike commerical applications, more users does not mean more revenue. Budgets are fixed and the pay-as-you-go model requires vigilance to not over-spend. Others? What documentation is available for researchers? There are general, conceptual introductions and dicussions for academics. https://cloud4scieng.org/ Book and website from Ian Foster and Gannon (U. Chicago), the text used for this fellowship. https://cloudmaven.github.io/documentation/ from the eScience institute of the University of Washington. It doesn't appear to be maintained but may have some good resources. Original github repositories are https://github.com/cloudmaven https://cloudbank-project.github.io/cb-resources/ Seems to be a succesor to the 'cloudmaven' documentation above as members from cloudmaven are contributing here. Cloudbank training videos NIST defintions of cloud: Service Levels and You The NIST definition of cloud computing defines service models, but what does \"X as a service\" actually mean, and where are the lines drawn? Like the species concept in biology, it's not always cut and dried, but can be thought of as a spectrum Infrastructure (aaS): Nuts and bolts, DIY, Lego. You need understanding of computing architecture as these services Everything in between: Platforms or pre-configured and managed infrastructure Software (aaS): Little to no configuration is needed but these system may be programmable and integrated with other services. E.g. Office 365, Google Drive The sweet-spot for researhces who do not have time to aquire the expertise to manage low-level infrastructure and need something more flexible and programmable than Software, are the platforms. These are often more expensive than DIY infrastruture, but are faster to provision and provide security controls. Cloud \"Services\" and the Packaging of Open Source Systems Case Study on Open Source system as Cloud service: MySQL Open source, free Relational database, e.g. SQL.

A \"Google Docs\" for Databases? Perhaps https://www.airtable.com/ ? Caveats and help As part of this fellowship, our goal is to help you translate documentation written for the systems and developer perspectives into a research perspective. The cloud services themselves are always changing, even slightly, making technology-specific tutorials obsolete in months. For example last year Azure had a \"Notebook Service\" for running Python notebooks, and now there is this in place of the regular documentation: What happened to Azure Notebooks? There are new services and bundles created all the time that may be competing or superior choices for doing research If you are unsure, ask us. See the contact page or use our Teams channel. During the cloud fellowship we are here to provide some answers, context for what you are seeing, or possible directions to explore. Cloud companies have help desks and many resources for anyone using their services or potential customers and we may be able to connect you with those. The Interfaces to Cloud A defining aspect of cloud computing is that it's \"on-demand\" hence creation of resources must be automated or \"scriptable.\" All Cloud providers have various 'interfaces' to their services that include both programmatic and web-based. We will talk about about how these in detail next sesion, but at the end of this session we will do a walk through of using the Azure portal, which is also an exercise for next session. Using workflow and computational thinking Karl Popper stated that \"non-reproducible single occurrences are of no significance to science\" ( K Popper, \"The Logic of Scientific Discovery\", English translation from Routledge, London, 1992, p. 66. ) and this is a significant issue for research computing and one of much academic work. To enhance reproducibility in your own work, consider documenting all the steps needed for create the environment to run your computation. For many on-premise academic systems (e.g. the MSU HPCC), we depend upon the system administrators to create that environment, but we may install and configure all the software we need to run our code. Workflow thinking can apply to the scienfic domain itself (e.g. \"Principles for data analysis workflows\" https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008770 ) and to the provisioning of the cloud computing environment. That is, we may use a workflow system for creating all the cloud stuff we need, and then a different workflow system that runs on that cloud stuff. One example is we may create an HPC system on Azure using templates and then launch the Slurm scheduler on that HPC to run our jobs. ( note the complexity of running our own HPC is beyond the scope of this fellowship and used as an example only ) A major advantage to using workflows or code for provisioning your cloud computing components is that you can turn them off and delete them when you are done, and restart when needed. This can dramatically save on costs . This does not necessarily have to be a complete programming system, but some combination of well written instructions and a collection of scripts so that your colleague (or yourself 6 months from now) can recreate everything you need. About Cloud Security Security and Risk management is an important issue even for researchers who's data may not be sensitive or even open source. Attackers may use the services you create to launch attacks on other services, leaving you liable. Finding a readable list of security recommendations for cloud computing is a challenge for all the reasons outlined above. Our textbook has a nice chaper outlining cloud security The \"Shared responsibility\" model for cloud computing takes a model of computing components, and shows how much of each component the user is responsible for security: Microsoft Model of Shared Responsibility for Cloud Computing We will come back to this model as we gain deeper understanding of research computing on the cloud. Costs and Budget overview We will cover the details of pricing, examine costs, and controlling costs in future sessions. Each participant has a budget for their Azure resources that they should stay under. If you need to use Google or AWS we need to make additional arrangements but your first step would be to acquire a free starter account with these companies (e.g. using a gmail address). Briefly: Costs are more than just dollars for services. Consider [Total Cost] = ( $ + Time + Risk ) [Total Time] = ( development time + wait time + compute time ) Risk is rarely non-significant. Never say \"I won't get hacked...\" In the Service level spectrum, the higher level \"platform\" services may have higher monetary costs but often reduce time and risk HPCC vs Cloud Dr. Parvizi's white paper outlines the challenges of adapting HPC workflows to cloud computing. The HPC is amazing effective at running all kinds of systems at very list cost, if any, to MSU researchers. Many systems not designed for HPC can be adjusted to run in that environment. However, just like many workflows are difficult to port from HPC to cloud, some cloud workflows are difficult run on HPC (but never say never): Big Data systems (see magpie project) Long-running Data Systems like database servers Web-based applications (see on-demand project) Containers (see singularity project) Acknowledging bias in access to cloud computing across research cultures Additional comments from instructors and organizers Summary and additional comments","title":"Practical Introduction for Researchers on Azure"},{"location":"session_introduction/lecture_introduction_to_cloud_computing_research/#practical-introduction-for-researchers-on-azure","text":"","title":"Practical Introduction for Researchers on Azure"},{"location":"session_introduction/lecture_introduction_to_cloud_computing_research/#introducing-cloud-computing-vs-research-computing","text":"","title":"Introducing cloud computing vs. research computing"},{"location":"session_introduction/lecture_introduction_to_cloud_computing_research/#learning-how-to-learn-about-cloud","text":"You may have looked at the various websites and poked around the web, and found it's just not clear at all how cloud computing may be helpful to you, even though it all sounds great. The challenge for researchers learning about cloud is that most cloud documentation for isn't written for you. Cloud training and documentation are mostly written for IT professionals like system admins and architects, software developers, business people, and agency managers. Researchers tend to be a little of all of those things. Training materials ofen have an embedded conceptual models of computing, and this model depend on your approach. Our goal as researchers is to get our work (or the work of our lab) done, not to build systems used by hundreds of people or for business purposes. That can make it difficult to decipher which kind of cloud service will work best for your use case. As Dr. Parvizi writes, cloud is very different from using traditional research-oriented technology like workstations or HPC. There are hundreds of services to choose from but we find many researchers will reach for the conceptually straightfoward path of creating cloud computers and install what they need. Our goal for this fellowship is to provide context and background, and help you explore some of the so-called \"cloud native\" technologies like \"serverless\" systems that let you run your scripts without dealing with operating system installs. The target audience for most cloud companies are IT professional building IT systems for public or institutational use. Let's call this the \"Systems\" perspective: built for someone else to use, e.g. a service must be available at scale and ultimately reliable documentation is in terms of historic IT systems house in on-premise corporate data centers \"production\" systems often very concerned with authentication and security The second audience are corporate software engineers, or dot-com or app software companies. We'll call this the \"developer perspective need to easily create systems to run their software for demonstration and testing complete interelate goal is a robust sytem that can handle many users, e.g. the performance of a \"production\" systems are often top of mind And finally most closely related to your work are data science, \"machine learning\" or an \"analytical\" perspective systems to achieve computation. May work like our local HPC systems built only for small work groups, not for public can still scale but must be reproducible to document methods even this documentation can quickly veer off in to building production systems for companies to re-run inference say many times a data or with a constant stream of corporate data What is are the goals from research perspective for cloud computing? Custom: can create customized resources only when you need it On-demand: can run ad-hoc computations on those on-demand resources Reproducible: a computation can be re-run as needed, meaning cloud resources can be easily re-recreated to re-run your computations. Cost effective: unlike commerical applications, more users does not mean more revenue. Budgets are fixed and the pay-as-you-go model requires vigilance to not over-spend.
