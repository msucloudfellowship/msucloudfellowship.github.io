### Schedule for Winter/Spring 2022

#### 2022 Cloud Computing Fellowship Meetings 

We will meet virtually according to the schedule below for 'project update' presentations and group discussions. If you have a scheduling conflict, please let us know as soon as possible.

We encourage you, especially during Winter/spring, to [contact us](contact) at any time with any questions related to your projects, the fellowship, or cloud computing in general.  We will get back with you when we can and schedule a time for a virtual 1-1 meeting.  

#### Symposium and Project Presentations

Participants will present projects in late April at a symposium for the Cloud Computing Fellowship.  The exact date and time to be determined, and virtual vs in-person also to be determined.   

## Textbook

We will occasionally link to the following book: 

**"Cloud Computing for Science and Engineering", Ian Foster and Dennis B. Gannon, September 2017**  

  * *[MIT Press website](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/cloud-computing-science-and-engineering)* 
  * Book Website : [Cloud4SciEng.org](https://cloud4scieng.org)

The book website does provide open access to individual chapters. 

## Communications

 Fellows are encouraged to contact us with questions or if they are ever stuck on an activity we've assigned.  In addition to email, we are utilizing Microsoft Teams at MSU (Fellows receive a link in the welcome email).   Please feel free to reach on out the MS Teams channel sent to participants at the beginning of the program.  Mentioning one of us e.g. @billspat or @parvizm will help get our attention.  Additionally you may email us at any time.   If you are not a participant but have questions about the program, see the [Contact page](contact.md) for how to get in touch with us.   

If you see a question or discussion on Teams please feel free to add any info or advice you may have, or even let us know that you have a similar question or issue.    

If you need interactive, on-going help it may be better to schedule a help session with a fellowship coordinator; and we are happy to meet individually for additional support.   This may be especially effective when fellows are developing their projects.  

We also save time during our synchronous meetings for group discussions, so please bring any concerns, difficulties, or successes to our sessions! 

## Meeting location

Given the state of the pandemic in late summer 2021, we are hosting our first meeting (September 3) via zoom.  Participants will be sent a link via email.   Locations for future meetings are to be determined and based on participant feedback.
