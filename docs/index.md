Welcome to the website for the MSU Cloud Computing Fellowship for 2022-2022.  See our "[about](about.md)" page for more information about the program.   


## Syllabus Fall 2022 - Spring 2023 

The program runs Fall semester through Winder/Spring semester.  

Fall Sessions are approximately bi-weekly with breaks for holidays.  A session includes preparatory readings and activities to orient you to the topic, followed by an in-person meeting on a Friday to review the materials, seminar, provide a venue for discussion,  hands-on collaborative activities, or presentations by the fellows. 

Winter/Spring sessions are for discussion and to provide updates to your project.   

### Symposium and Project Presentations

The culmination of the fellowship is a project resulting in a write-up and presentation during the spring symposium, typically held late-April or early-May.

### On-going help

We encourage you, especially during Winter/spring, to [contact us](contact) at any time with any questions related to your projects, the fellowship, or cloud computing in general.  


## Textbook

We will occasionally link to the following book: 

**"Cloud Computing for Science and Engineering", Ian Foster and Dennis B. Gannon, September 2017**  

  * *[MIT Press website](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/cloud-computing-science-and-engineering)* 
  * Book Website : [Cloud4SciEng.org](https://cloud4scieng.org)

The book website does provide open access to individual chapters. 

## Communications

 Fellows are encouraged to contact us with questions or if they are ever stuck on an activity we've assigned.  In addition to email, we are utilizing Microsoft Teams at MSU (Fellows receive a link in the welcome email).   Please feel free to reach on out the MS Teams channel sent to participants at the beginning of the program.  Mentioning one of us e.g. @billspat or @parvizm will help get our attention.  Additionally you may email us at any time.   If you are not a participant but have questions about the program, see the [Contact page](contact.md) for how to get in touch with us.   

If you see a question or discussion on Teams please feel free to add any info or advice you may have, or even let us know that you have a similar question or issue.    

If you need interactive, on-going help it may be better to schedule a help session with a fellowship coordinator; and we are happy to meet individually for additional support.   This may be especially effective when fellows are developing their projects.  

We also save time during our synchronous meetings for group discussions, so please bring any concerns, difficulties, or successes to our sessions!
