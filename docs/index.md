Welcome to the website for the MSU Cloud Computing Fellowship for 2022-2022.  These pages are under developmente as we get organized for 2022.  See our "[about](about.md)" page for more information about the program.   

## Applications

Applications are currently closed for this year but we encourage PhD students and MSU Post-doc faculty to look for an announcement in Summer of 2023.   We are reviewing applications and will contact all applications in August 2022.  

## Syllabus 

The program runs from Fall 2022 to Spring 2023 semester.  Sessions are organized with pre-meeting materials (readings and videos), pre-requisites, and activities, which allow fellows to prepare for our Friday meetings where we will have hands-on activities and discussion.   For examples of previous materials, see the [schedule for 2021](index2021)

### Schedule for Winter/Spring 2023

The second semester of the fellowship is focused on completing a project based on fellow research interests.   We will meet approximately bi-weekly for fellows to present, get feedback, ask questions, and group discussions.  For some of these dates/times, fellows will deliver a short presentation about their projects as follows:

 - **Early January TBD**: Presentation of Project proposal
 - **Late February TBD**: Presentation of Project status
 - **April: TBD**: Presentation of Project status

Other activities during our bi-weekly sessions 
        
#### Virtual Office Hours Sessions

We will also hold two Friday virtual helpdesk sessions per month, and encourage fellows to take advantage of these voluntary sessions for help with specifics on your project, presentations, and/or general research computing topics. 
 
We encourage you, especially during Winter/spring, to [contact us](contact) at any time with any questions related to your projects, the fellowship, or cloud computing in general.  

#### Symposium and Project Presentations

We will hold a Symposium for participants for final presentations of the outcome projects in late April/Early May.   

## Textbook

We will occasionally link to the following book: 

**"Cloud Computing for Science and Engineering", Ian Foster and Dennis B. Gannon, September 2017**  

  * *[MIT Press website](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/cloud-computing-science-and-engineering)* 
  * Book Website : [Cloud4SciEng.org](https://cloud4scieng.org)

The book website does provide open access to individual chapters. 

## Communications

 Fellows are encouraged to contact us with questions or if they are ever stuck on an activity we've assigned.  In addition to email, we are utilizing Microsoft Teams at MSU (Fellows receive a link in the welcome email).   Please feel free to reach on out the MS Teams channel sent to participants at the beginning of the program.  Mentioning one of us e.g. @billspat or @parvizm will help get our attention.  Additionally you may email us at any time.   If you are not a participant but have questions about the program, see the [Contact page](contact.md) for how to get in touch with us.   

If you see a question or discussion on Teams please feel free to add any info or advice you may have, or even let us know that you have a similar question or issue.    

If you need interactive, on-going help it may be better to schedule a help session with a fellowship coordinator; and we are happy to meet individually for additional support.   This may be especially effective when fellows are developing their projects.  

We also save time during our synchronous meetings for group discussions, so please bring any concerns, difficulties, or successes to our sessions! 

## Meeting location

At this time meetings are planned be in-person in the training room of the Institute for Cyber-Enabled Research, located on the first floor of the MSU Biomedical & Physical Sciences Building (off of the atrium)

567 Wilson Road, Room 1440
Michigan State University
