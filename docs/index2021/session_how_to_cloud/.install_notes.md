## Installation and config notes for a VM that students can use

( this is not part of the website)

The MS DSVM sounds cool but there is no great way to connect until you do a bunch of other stuff. 
 
- remote X destkop that's install wants you to install a special X client on laptop
- remote desktop .. does that even work on dsvm?
- Restudio server that's installed is disabled and then won't even start.  It's an old version.
    - the latest version of rstudio server on the website does not start, linked against the wrong libssl for ubnutu 18
    - this one did work : rstudio-server-1.4.673-amd64.deb
    - after installing had restart to take it 'on-line' and maybe even enabled it 
        - `sudo systemctl enable rstudio-server`
        - `sudo rstudio-server online`   I don't know if this survives reboots
    - had to log-in with system userid/pw
    
- jupyter hub is up and running but on https with self-signed cert !  long insructions on installing our own cert. 

if there is a ton of stuff to fix or install to use it after creation, you don't want to delete it.  Then it's not useable for one-off analysis.  it becomes a pet, not cattle.  useless for research IT. 

can we make a VM that has similar things install but 'turnkey' OR with scripts to fix this stuff.  

Rstudio install on Unbuntu 18 (common vm)

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9
sudo add-apt-repository 'deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic-cran40/'
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install gdebi-core r-base
curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio-ide-build/server/bionic/amd64/rstudio-server-1.4.673-amd64.deb
gdebi rstudio-server-1.4.673-amd64.deb
# needed?
# sudo systemctl enable rstudio-server
sudo rstudio-server online
```

Another method for a remote desktop: 

Installing VNC on an ubunut VM:  https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip235.html

Open the firewall to this port but just for the users IP address

 - get your IP address
 - 
Windows will be required to install a VNC client https://www.tightvnc.com

MacOS comes with :

open /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Screen\ Sharing.app

Or 

/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Screen\ Sharing.app/Contents/MacOS/Screen\ Sharing
