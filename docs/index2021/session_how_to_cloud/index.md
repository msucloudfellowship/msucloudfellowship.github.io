# Session 2: What is the cloud and how does it work?  An introduction using Virtual Machines

![Chaplin still from Modern Times 1936](../img/chaplin_clockworks.jpg){ align=right} When many people think of "cloud computing" they think of computers in the cloud, or virtual machines.   Cloud computing companies offer much more than just virtualized hardware, but this is a good place to start.   This session is designed to be a hands-on workshop where we walk-through creating the resources needed for to run a computer in the cloud, logging into this computer, copying data and using that data in a program.    At the end of the session you should have a good introduction of what it means to "cloud compute."

## Readings

#### Cloud background

  - [The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf)  The framework that most widely used to describe aspects of cloud computing, and categorize cloud sevices.

#### Other References

These resources are abstract introductions or discussions about cloud computing, mostly from an academic perspective.  However "academic" can also mean those responsible for maintaining a university's IT infrastructure or websites.   

  - [Wikipedia article on cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) is actually pretty good

   Written only 3 years after the launch of AWS, this is very insightful discussion of the value of cloud computing
