# Session 7: The Cloud Computing Grab Bag That is Serverless

Introductory Material by topic

* [Overview of Serverless](serverless_overview.md)

* [About Linux Containers](linux_containers_and_the_cloud.md) with readings and activities


## Serverless and FaaS Readings

As you read these materials, do you think  "serverless" resources are IaaS or PaaS?   They sure feel like infrastructure as they require significant configuration, but run like PaaS, hence they are often called "Function as a Service." 

- Re-visit [Chapter 4 Computing as a service](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/a-book/computing.html) 

- An additional report [Serverless Computing and FaaS](https://cloud4scieng.org/serverless-computing-and-faas/)  *"Observations about Serverless Computing, With a few examples from AWS Lambda, Azure Functions and Open Whisk"* by Dennis Gannon

- All About Azure Functions: https://www.serverless360.com/azure-functions

- Example pricing for Azure functions: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/functions/
