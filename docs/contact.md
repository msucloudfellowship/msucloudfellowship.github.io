If you are a Cloud Computing Fellowship participant this year (or past participant!), please contact the instructors [Pat Bills](mailto:billspat@msu.edu) or [Mahmoud Parvizi](mailto:parvizim@msu.edu) with any issues or questions related to the material or activities.  

The [session meetings](https://msucloudfellowship.github.io/#schedule-for-fall-2021) are designed to have plenty of time for questions, troubleshooting and discussion.   We will also schedule office hours prior to meeting times to help with pre-meeting activities.
